TITLE	New skin cancer warning for dark-haired easy tanners

They are widely seen as being protected from the sun by their genetic make-up. 

But a new study suggests dark-haired people who do not burn easily should beware of being lulled into a false sense of security. 

The U.S. researchers have identified a gene variant that more than doubles the risk of skin cancer in people with dark hair, while having no effect in blondes or redheads.

And sunbathers who carry the gene and tan immediately without burning face an almost 10 times higher risk, the scientists warn. 

The mutation, in a gene called MC1R, was also associated with a more than trebling of risk in people with dark eyes, and an eightfold increase in those who did not freckle.

Study leader Dr Peter Kanetsky, from the University of Pennsylvania, said: 'Traditionally a clinician might look at a person with dark hair who did not sunburn easily and classify them as at lower risk for melanoma (skin cancer), but that may not be true for all people in the population.'

Dr Kanetsky's team compared the DNA of 779 patients with melanoma and 325 healthy patients.

Overall, people with certain MC1R variants faced more than double the risk of melanoma. But this risk was largely confined to patients who would not normally be considered susceptible to developing skin cancer from too much sun, the study revealed.

The findings were presented today at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Denver, Colorado.
