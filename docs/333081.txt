TITLE	Organic ketchup could help fight cancer

Last updated at 10:29 06 January 2005

Organic varieties of tomato ketchup contain up to three times more of the cancer-fighting chemical lycopene than non-organic brands, it has been claimed.

American researchers made the discovery after studying a wide range of ketchups, including purple and green varieties which are sold in the US.

Lycopene has been shown to protect against breast, pancreatic, prostate and bowel cancer, especially when eaten with fatty foods.

There is also evidence it can reduce the risk of heart attacks.

Mary Chapman and Betty Ishida, from the Agricultural Research Service in Albany, California, tested lycopene levels and antioxidant activity in 13 ketchup brands, New Scientist magazine reported.

Six were popular varieties, two were stores' own brands, three were organic and two were obtained from fast-food chains.

New Scientist said: "Purple and green ketchups had a similar lycopene content to their plain red counterparts. But organic ketchups excelled, with one brand containing 183 micrograms of lycopene per gram of ketchup, about five times as much per weight as a tomato."

Non-organic brands averaged 100 micrograms per gram, with one fast-food sample containing just 60 micrograms per gram.

In general, the best way to ensure the highest lycopene levels was to pick the darkest red ketchup, the scientists said.
