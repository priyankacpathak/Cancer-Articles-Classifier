TITLE	Cancer dye found in Grossman curry sauce

Last updated at 16:20 24 March 2005

A batch of curry sauce in celebrity chef Loyd Grossman's food range has been found to contain a potentially cancer-causing dye.

Tests by makers Premier Foods showed Sudan 1 was present at 'very low levels' in Loyd Grossman Red Lentil Dhansak Curry Sauce, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) said.

The contaminated sauces have been removed from sale and the FSA advise anyone with any of it at home to contact the store where they bought it for a refund.

The fresh alert comes after the recall of hundreds of products following the discovery of Sudan 1 in a batch of chilli powder used by Premier Foods to make a consignment of Crosse and Blackwell Worcester Sauce.

The FSA said: "The Agency was told by Premier Foods that tests had confirmed the presence of Sudan 1 at very low levels in a batch of the sauce.

"Only this one batch has been found to be contaminated by Sudan 1, a chemical dye which is illegal in food.

"As part of the agency's investigation launched last month into how a number of food products became contaminated with Sudan 1, the Agency will be investigating how this latest incident happened."

Small risk

The agency stressed the risk from Sudan 1 at the levels present in the product was very small but said it would be sensible not to eat it.

The affected jars have a best before date of the end of July 2006 and have been on sale at a limited number of Waitrose and Sainsbury supermarkets.
