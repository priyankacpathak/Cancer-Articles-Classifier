TITLE	Hairdressers at greater risk of cancer because of hair dye

 Hairdressers and barbers could have an increased risk of developing cancer, claim researchers. 

 

 

Exposure to hair dyes raises the risk of certain types of the disease, notably bladder cancer, they say. 

 Dark hair dyes carry the greatest risk although the use of some colouring ingredients was discontinued in the 1970s. 

Positive cancer tests in rats led to their withdrawal, says the latest working group report of the International Agency for Research on Cancer. 

The group also looked at the personal use of hair dyes but decided there was "inadequate" evidence to come to a judgment as to whether or not the practice would lead to an increased cancer risk. 

Dr Robert Baan and colleagues from the agency, based in Lyon, France, said many studies had been carried out on cancer in hairdressers, beauticians and barbers since the previous assessment in 1993. 

"A small, but consistent, risk of bladder cancer was reported in male hairdressers and barbers," their report in The Lancet Oncology said. 

"Because of the few supporting findings by duration or period of exposure, the working group considered these data as limited evidence of carcinogenicity and re-affirmed occupational exposures of hairdressers and barbers as "probably carcinogenic to humans." 

The hair dye industry says colorants are among the most thoroughly studied products on the market.
