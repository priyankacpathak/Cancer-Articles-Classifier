TITLE	Skin cancer cases soar by 16%

Last updated at 08:50 08 January 2004

Foreign holidays in the sun have triggered an epidemic of deadly skin cancers, according to alarming new figures.

Cases of malignant melanoma rose by 16 per cent in a year and have leapt 24 per cent in just five years.

It is a stark warning of the dangers of over-exposure to the sun as Britons increasingly take both winter and summer breaks, say experts.

Malignant melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, killing one in four victims on average.

There were 6,967 cases diagnosed in the UK in 2000, compared with 5,990 in 1999. In 1995, there were 5,626 cases.

Deaths have rocketed since the 1960s, when the fashion for sunbathing holidays took off.

But campaigners say cases are climbing again because people spend more time in winter heading for sunspots and skiing without protection from ultraviolet rays - which are intensified at high altitudes.

Richard Hoey of Cancer Research UK, which released the figures yesterday, said the tragedy is that malignant melanoma is almost entirely preventable.

He added: &#39;It&#39;s a huge increase in just a year and shows that the message about the dangers of sun exposure are not getting through.

&#39;The main cause is spending more time in the sun without taking precautions to minimise the damage.

&#39;Many more people are now spending time abroad on holidays at all times of the year and, of course, if we see a consistent rise in temperatures at home, that will increase the risk.&#39;

Records showed that 2003 was one of the UK&#39;s sunniest years ever.

Mr Hoey said one of the most worrying aspects of the epidemic is that sunbathing puts people of all ages at risk, whereas cancer is normally more common in older age groups.

His charity now has Government funding of &pound;150,000 for an annual SunSmart campaign giving advice to holidaymakers about sensible behavour in the sun.

It includes: Stay in the shade between 11am and 3pm; make sure you never burn; always cover up; use factor 15+ sunscreen and reapply often; keep babies out of the sun completely; report mole changes or unusual skin growths promptly to your doctor. Mr Hoey said: &#39;We know sun awareness campaigns can make a difference.

&#39;In Australia, there has been an increase in early detection of malignant melanoma and survival rates are excellent. Everyone knows about looking for moles.&#39;

Figures show 7,850 melanoma cases are diagnosed in Australia each year - almost 1,000 more than in the UK - yet the number of deaths is 1,000 a year compared to 1,600 in Britain.
