TITLE	Tanning pill 'will cut skin cancer'

Last updated at 09:21 03 December 2003

A deep tan can take much time and effort to achieve, not to mention the cost of going abroad in search of the sun.

It could all become a lot easier, however, with a drug which can tan your body with minimal exertion, even if you stay indoors.

The tan, which develops over three weeks and lasts three months - is slowly released from a matchstick-sized implant under the skin.

A potent synthetic hormone, Melanotan, is dispersed via the blood system. This stimulates the cells which produce melanin, the dark skin pigment that provides a natural sunblock against ultraviolet light.

Scientists in Australia claim the drug can cut in half the damage caused to fair-skinned people, who are more at risk of skin cancer because they have low levels of melanin.

Melanotan is undergoing extensive trials in Australia, where skin cancer rates are high. Deaths from the disease have soared since the 1960s.

In the UK, 6,000 cases of melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer, were reported in 2000.

Australian firm Epi-Tan has pumped millions into developing the implant, which could be available within three years.

Final patient trials are scheduled for 2005 in Australia, Europe and the U.S.
