TITLE	Lung cancer deaths down as women stop smoking

by JENNY HOPE, Daily Mail

The number of women under 70 dying of lung cancer has dropped to its lowest level in 30 years.

Experts say this is because more women are giving up smoking - a trend that has already led to a drop in the number of men dying of the disease.

Tobacco is the main cause of lung cancer, with nine out of ten cases linked to the habit.

Sir Richard Peto of Cancer Research UK said: 'Half of the people who keep on smoking will eventually be killed by it, but stopping works surprisingly well.

'Those who stop smoking before they have lung cancer or some other serious disease avoid most of their risk.'

In 1988, nearly 6,000 women under 70 and 6,300 women over 70 died of lung cancer.

By 2001, the toll of younger women was 4,550 and older women 8,500 - suggesting rates will continue to fall as the population ages.

The high figure for those over 70 is the result of a smoking boom among women after World War II.

However, doctors are concerned deaths may pick up again, as women are less likely than men to give up cigarettes, and studies show increasing numbers of teenage girls started smoking in the 1990s.

The figures have been released to mark Lung Cancer Awareness Month in January.
