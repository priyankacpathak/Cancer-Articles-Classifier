TITLE	Can patches give you cancer?

by BEEZY MARSH, Daily Mail

Nicotine patches, chewing gum and sprays used by nearly two million Britons each year have been linked to cancer.

A study by a leading cancer expert has sparked fears that popular methods of giving up smoking could have long-term health implications.

Researchers discovered that chemicals released by nicotine can break down in the body into a known cancer-causing agent.

The chemical, NNK, is specifically linked to the development of lung cancer, which claims an estimated 30,000 lives in Britain each year. But the use of patches, sprays and gums means other areas of the body could now be at risk.

The threat is thought to be greatest for people who keep using the products beyond the short to medium term for which they are intended.

The research, published in the prestigious American medical journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the first to link nicotine to cancer.

Until now, experts thought that nicotine simply made people addicted, while the cancer risk came from the 100 known carcinogens released into the body by smoking a single cigarette.

The revelation will be a major shock to the estimated five million smokers - out of a total of 13million - who try to quit in the UK each year. Nicotine replacement therapy has become a key aid, creating a &pound;35million a year industry
