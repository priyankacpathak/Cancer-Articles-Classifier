TITLE	Stopping HRT 'has cut breast cancer'

Last updated at 11:51 15 December 2006

There has been a sharp decline in new breast cancer cases because millions of older women have stopped hormone replacement therapy, researchers have claimed. However, they stressed they are not completely certain why they are linked.

Scientists found an overall seven per cent relative decline in breast cancer incidence between 2002 and 2003, in a U.S study.

The researchers from the University of Texas said 14,000 fewer women were diagnosed with the disease in 2003 than in 2002, a year in which there were an estimated 203,500 new US cases.

They found the steepest decline occurred in women between the ages of 50 to 69 who had been diagnosed with a type of breast cancer fuelled by the hormone oestrogen.

"It is the largest single drop in breast cancer incidence within a single year I am aware of," said Dr Peter Ravdin.

"Something went right in 2003, and it seems that it was the decrease in the use of hormone therapy, but from the data we used we can only indirectly infer that is the case," he said.

HRT provides the hormone oestrogen and sometimes also progestin to women after menopause. But a big study in 2002 suggested that the combination of oestrogen and progestin raised the risk of breast cancer.

This brought a premature halt to a study of more than 16,600 women between 50 and 79 who were using HRT, and caused widespread confusion.

More analysis of that study also showed that HRT could raise the risk of heart disease and especially strokes and HRT was abandoned except as a way to relieve the most debilitating and stressful symptoms of menopause, such as hot flushes and insomnia.

The study was presented at the 29th annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.
