TITLE	Vitamin A drug may help young cancer patients

Last updated at 11:50 04 May 2006

Younger breast cancer patients could have their risk of developing a second tumour cut by a new vitamin A drug.

Researchers found the drug fenretinide reduced second cancers in pre-menopausal women by 38 per cent and halved the risk in those under 40. However, the cancer rate actually increased among post-menopausal women taking the drug.

Fenretinide is a synthetic version of retinol, or active vitamin A, which can combat some tumour types.

The study followed 1,700 women between 12 and 16 years. There were 83 second cancers in the fenretinide group compared with 126 in the control group in pre-menopausal women.

In post-menopausal women, there were 85 new cancers among patients taking fenretinide compared with 64 given an inactive control drug.

More research

But Dr Sarah Rawlings from Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: "Significantly more research is needed before any conclusions can be drawn.

"The researchers themselves say they are not yet in a position to make any clinical recommendations."

She warned that high doses of vitamin A can be harmful to unborn babies and cause other health problems.
