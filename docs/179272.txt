TITLE	High-fibre diet does beat cancer

A high-fibre diet is good for us after all, says new research.

The debate over fibre's benefits has been raging for some time. On Thursday US researchers claimed, after a study spanning almost 30 years, there was no link between diets including fruit, vegetables and grain and cancer.

But two separate studies, both published in the medical journal The Lancet, today prove that there is a link.

One European study found that eating cereals, fruit and vegetables - around 35g a day - can almost halve the risk of bowel cancer. The disease affects 30,000 Britons a year.

A second study revealed that the majority of bowel cancer sufferers were also those with the least fibre in their diets. The study concluded that doubling fibre intake can cut bowel cancer risk by 40 per cent.

Dr Sheila Bingham, head of diet and cancer group for the Medical Research Council, told reporters: "It is good news.

"We know that at least a third or up to 80 per cent of cases are caused by something that we are doing and not genetic factors."

But she also accepted that should strong links be accepted between diet and cancer, it would still require people to undergo big changes in their diets and stick to them.
