TITLE	Olive oil could prevent deadly cancer

Olive oil could safeguard against one of the most deadly forms of cancer, researchers have claimed.

Scientists at the University of Ulster found a mixture of compounds, called phenols, extracted from virgin olive oil could offer protection against colon cancer, the second highest cause of cancer fatalities in the US.

Dr Chris Gill said the research - which used in vitro cell models - supported the long-held belief in the benefits of the Mediterranean diet, which is rich in olive oil.

"We found that incubation of one cancer cell line with increasing concentrations of olive oil phenols for 24 hours protected the cells from DNA damage," the scientist said.

"The effect of olive oil phenols on another cell line after 48 hours of exposure suggested that they 'may exert an anti-promoter effect in the carcinogenesis pathway'."

Olive oil is high in mono-unsaturated fat and a good source of antioxidants.

On the significance of the research, Dr Gill said: "While the findings are purely of an experimental nature, they identify mechanisms that support the scientific and medical evidence suggesting an association between olive oil consumption and decreased risk of cancer.

"The research shows that the effect is not only related to the types of fat present in the oil but also the phenolic compounds present."

He said the next stage would be to test the theory on an animal.

The team, who were led by Professor Ian Rowland, will publish their findings in the International Journal of Cancer.
