TITLE	Do implants increase your risk of breast cancer?

Dr Mr Davies, can you tell me if having breast implants increases your risk of breast cancer?

I have heard that mammograms are unable to see through the implant to pick up any cancers - is this true?

Also, I have saline implants and every now and then my left breast gets hot for a while but there is no pain. What could be causing this? Thank you.
