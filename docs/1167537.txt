TITLE	'I fear that shampoo gives cancer to children': Experts fury at Gwyneth Paltrow's 'loopy' health claims

Gwyneth Paltrow has been branded &#8216;loopy&#8217; by scientists after warning that products such as shampoo could be linked to cancer.

The actress and wife of Coldplay singer Chris Martin says she was &#8216;seized with fear&#8217; after reading research about what she calls &#8216;environmental toxins&#8217; &#8211; chemicals which are present in everyday items. 

Miss Paltrow, who won an Oscar for her role in Shakespeare In Love, said children were unable to easily break down toxins and claimed the number of children getting cancer and autism was growing &#8216;exponentially&#8217;. 

Leading bacteriologist Professor Hugh Pennington described her claims as &#8216;rubbish&#8217; and &#8216;loopy&#8217;. 

And Cancer Research UK said the number of children with cancer had not changed in the past ten years and there was no known environmental cause for the disease. 

Miss Paltrow, 36, has embraced an alternative lifestyle, raising her children, Apple and Moses, on a macrobiotic diet which excludes foods such as cheese and white flour in favour of grains, vegetables and beans. 

She made the claims on her website goop.com, where she usually airs her views on her favourite restaurants and organic food recipes. 

She said: &#8216;A couple of years ago I was asked to give a quote for a book concerning environmental toxins and their effects on our children. While reading up on the subject, I was seized with fear about what the research said. 

&#8216;Foetuses, infants and toddlers are basically unable to metabolize toxins the way that adults are, and we are constantly filling our environments with chemicals that may or may not be safe.

&#8216;The research is troubling; the incidence of diseases in children such as asthma, cancer and autism have shot up exponentially and many children we all know and love have been diagnosed with developmental issues like ADHD [Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder].&#8217;

Miss Paltrow quotes Dr Philip Landrigan, a paediatrician at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in California, saying that children are &#8216;at risk of exposure&#8217; to 80,000 chemicals.

He adds: &#8216;Nearly all of these are new chemicals developed in the past 50 years. 

'These chemicals are used widely in consumer and household goods, like personal care products, cleaning supplies, pesticides, paints, toys, home furnishings, carpeting and electronics.&#8217; 

Dr Landrigan claims that asthma rates and childhood obesity have increased, as well as leukaemia and brain cancer, commenting: &#8216;These increases of chronic disease in our children are a stark warning that something is going very wrong.&#8217;

Miss Paltrow also cites campaigner Christopher Gavigan, saying: &#8216;Ever read the chemical ingredients list on your shampoo or lotion? 

'Not an easy task. Sixty per cent of what goes on the skin is absorb [sic] into the body &#8211; so avoiding chemicals here is super important, especially for pregnant moms.&#8217;

The actress&#8217;s suggestions of a possible link between chemicals and cancer were rubbished by scientists. 

Professor Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at Aberdeen University, said: &#8216;It&#8217;s a load of nonsense. Shampoo is perfectly safe, unless you drink it in large quantities.&#8217;

The professor, who advises the Government&#8217;s Food Standards Agency and was chairman of an inquiry into an outbreak of e.coli in 1996, added: &#8216;There has been an obsession about carcinogenic chemicals for years and we have been successful in getting rid of most of them. 

&#8216;It does annoy me when celebrities use their position to spout nonsense. They have a perfect right to their views, even if they are loopy, but they do hold a position of influence. You may as well ask someone on the Underground.&#8217;

Cancer Research UK said there was no evidence to support Miss Paltrow&#8217;s claim that childhood cancer rates had increased &#8216;exponentially&#8217;. 

Its director of cancer information, Dr Lesley Walker, said: &#8216;There has been very little change in the number of childhood cancers detected during the past ten years.&#8217; 

Dr Walker added: &#8216;There are a lot of scare stories around environmental carcinogens but there is scant evidence to back this up.&#8217;
