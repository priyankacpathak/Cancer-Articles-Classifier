TITLE	Is HPV linked to cervical cancer?

Thanks for your question. There are various strains or types of HPV or 'Herpes Papilloma Virus', as you have said. The most common type which causes warts is not linked to cervical cancer.

When studies have looked at HPV carriage among sexually active young people, around two thirds are at least transiently infected with HPV at some point in their lives, making it the most common sexually transmitted infection.

The particular types associated with cervical pre-cancer and cancer are generally those which don't cause genital warts, although the two can exist together.

The potentially nasty ones are called HPV 16, 18, 31, 33 and 35. Although these are identified in research studies, it is not usual to categorise the HPV sub-type when a smear result comes back, so all are lumped together.

It is unlikely that HPV will affect your fertility. As I mentioned, most cases are temporary and your body may well be able to deal with the infection adequately. It might be that you have had the genital warts treated to help you get rid of the HPV.

If you have a smear test which persistently shows HPV, your doctor might suggest treatment, but this can usually be quite conservative unless there are other changes to suggest something more than just the wart virus.

 If you want to help prevent HPV and cervical cancer the best way is to use a condom and avoid smoking which is another risk factor.
