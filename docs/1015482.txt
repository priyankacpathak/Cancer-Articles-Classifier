TITLE	How astronauts risk cancer - and premature ageing - by space travel

Astronauts who spend too much time in space may be at risk of premature ageing and cancer, research suggests. 

A study by U.S. scientists could have major implications for plans to build Moon bases and send explorers to Mars. 

Researchers at Georgetown University Medical Centre in Washington, DC, discovered that space radiation may be more damaging than previously thought. 

Mice exposed to the high-energy particles found in space developed a harmful stress response. 

Their radiated cells generated large numbers of free radicals - the destructive molecules that can damage DNA, leading to cancer. 

The effect was most pronounced in the gut, where the response continued for up to two months. The mice also aged rapidly. 

This kind of damage was likely to increase the risk of colon cancer, the scientists said yesterday during a presentation at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in San Diego, California. 

Dr Kamal Datta, who led the study, said: "With plans for a mission to Mars, we need to understand more about the nature of radiation in space."
