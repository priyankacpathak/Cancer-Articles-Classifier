TITLE	Eating to beat cancer

by NAOMI COLEMAN, femail.co.uk

Eating a healthy diet can equip us with powerful weapons to help protect us against cancer - and there are certain foods that offer more defence than others.

According to the World Cancer Research Fund, 30 to 40 per cent of cancers are directly related to the foods we eat, our weight and activity levels.

It is well established that a Mediterranean diet rich in fruit, vegetables, oily fish, wheat and grains lowers the risk of cancer and can reduce our cancer risk by 25 per cent.

Catherine Collins, chief dietician at London's St George's Hospital, says: 'Eating a wide variety of food types keeps our immune system strong and helps mop up free radicals - negatively charged molecules which roam our bodies in their millions looking to damage our cells.'

Interestingly, a study published in the Journal of American Medical Association last week showed that food supplements such as vitamin pills do not offer the same protection against cancer as actual food.

'This points to the fact that food in its natural state can be a powerful weapon against cancer,' says Catherine Collins.

However, there's no scientific proof yet that it is possible to reverse the effects of cancer by eating food.

'There is no evidence to show that eating the right foods can cure cancer,' says Collins. 'But cutting down on fatty foods and maintaining a balanced diet rich in starch, fruit and vegetables can keep our immune system strong and help fight off cancer-causing toxins,' she says.
