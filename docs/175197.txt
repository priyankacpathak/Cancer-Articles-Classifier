TITLE	Cancer linked to long-term Pill use

Women who take the contraceptive pill over several years dramatically increase their risk of cervical cancer, a major new study shows.

Researchers found that the risk doubled after 10 years or more of pill use.

The study, which pooled data from 12,500 women with cervical cancer in 24 countries, found a strong link between rising risk and length of exposure to the pill.

Taking the pill for five years or less was associated with a 10% increased cancer risk, compared with never taking it.

The risk elevation soared to 60% with five to nine years of use, and doubled at 10 years.

Doctors stressed that it was still unknown to what extent the risk remained after a woman stopped taking the pill.

But the findings are robust enough to remove any doubts about a genuine link between oral contraceptives and cervical cancer.

Although previous studies have indicated an association, the evidence was unclear until now.

Researcher Dr Amy Berrington, from Cancer Research UK's Epidemiology Unit at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, said: "This study shows that use of hormonal contraceptives for long periods of time may increase the risk of cervical cancer.

"However, the public health implications of these findings largely depend on whether this risk remains long after use of hormonal contraceptives has stopped and this cannot be properly evaluated from published data."
