TITLE	Lip gloss linked to increased risk of skin cancer

 Shiny lip glosses and balms may increase the risk of skin cancer.

Rather than protecting the lips, the glosses may attract ultra-violet rays, warns a dermatologist from Baylor University Medical Centre in America.

 'The skin on your lips is very thin and is more prone to ageing from sun damage, compared to the skin on your body. Many people forget that it is as important to protect the lips with sunscreen as the rest of the skin,' says Dr Christine Brown.

'The prognosis for skin cancer on the lip can be worse, as such cancers are more likely to spread to surrounding lymph nodes,' she added.

 The incidence of skin cancer in the UK is increasing and nearly all cases are linked to sun exposure. They can be cured if detected early.

 Nina Goad, from the British Association of Dermatologists, says: 'It is thought that oils applied to the skin can magnify UV exposure, so lip products consisting of oils could have the same effect. Certainly many lip products do not contain an SPF, so will not offer any protection against the sun.'
