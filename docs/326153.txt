TITLE	Australians warned of backyard cancer risk

Last updated at 09:17 15 November 2004

Australians are more at risk of contracting deadly skin cancer in their home backyards gardening, barbecuing or simply hanging out the washing than on the beach.

A national skin cancer survey, "From beach burns to backyard scorchings," found Australians were twice as likely to get sunburnt in the backyard as on the beach, the Cancer Council of Australia said today.

Cancer is the leading cause of death in Australia, killing more than 35,500 people each year. Skin cancer is the most common, with more than 85,000 people diagnosed with the disease every year.

"Australians seem to be associating sun protection with the beach but not with their incidental outdoor activity," said Dr Andrew Penman, spokesman of the Cancer Council, at the launch of national skin cancer action week.

The survey found eight per cent of Australians went to the beach each weekend, but 29 per cent spent time gardening or working around the home. One in five Australians were sunburnt on summer weekends. Of those, 32 per cent were burnt gardening or working around the house while 17 per cent were burnt at the beach or in the water.

Another 24 per cent were burnt while engaging in outdoor activities such as picnics and barbecues. Sunburn increases the risk of skin cancer later in life.
