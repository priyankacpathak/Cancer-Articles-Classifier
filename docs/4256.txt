TITLE	HRT: The breast cancer link

by JENNY HOPE, Daily Mail

Women using HRT face a slightly increased risk of breast cancer - but it is less likely to be fatal, according to new research.

A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association confirms earlier findings that women who take HRT to improve their lives after the menopause develop a 'better type of breast cancer' rather than more invasive forms of the disease.

It shows that using HRT for five years or less raises the chances of developing breast cancer by about 2 pc each year, rising slightly higher for those using it for longer.

It found that only breast tumours which are the most easily-treatable type were linked to using HRT.

The research involving 37,000 postmenopausal women was carried out by Susan Gapstur and colleagues from Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago.

Dr Gapstur said: 'While women are using HRT there is a slight increase in risk of breast cancer, and that risk increases the longer women take HRT. We found that when they stop taking HRT this excess risk disappears and five years after stopping use the risk has virtually vanished.

'The extra cancers diagnosed are more easily treatable, so we don't know how we can translate these into deaths.

'The issue is to do with the balance of risks. If there is protection from coronary heart disease, that may well balance out any excess risk.'
