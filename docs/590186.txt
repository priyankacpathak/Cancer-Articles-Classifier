TITLE	How to protect yourself

Last updated at 11:00 28 March 2003

The campaign urges Britons to follow five simple steps to reduce the risk of skin cancer.

Stay in the shade from 11am to 3pm. The sun is at its most dangerous in the middle of the day - find shade under umbrellas, trees, canopies or indoors.

Make sure you never burn. Sunburn can double your risk of skin cancer.

Always cover up. Sunscreen is not enough - wear a T-shirt and a wide-brimmed hat. Eyes get sundamaged, too, so wear wraparound sunglasses.

Remember to take extra care with children. Young skin is delicate - be sure to keep babies and young children out of the sun completely.

Use factor 15-plus sunscreen. Apply it generously 15-30 minutes before you go outside, as it does not work immediately. Re-apply often.

There are several tell-tale signs to watch for if you think you may have developed skin cancer. These are:

An inflamed mole or one with a reddish edge;

A mole that starts to bleed, ooze or crust;

A change in sensation of a mole, like a mild itch;

A mole that is bigger than your other moles.

You should see your doctor immediately if:

An existing mole or dark patch is getting larger or a new one is growing;

A mole has a ragged outline - ordinary moles are smooth and regular;

A mole has a mixture of different shades of brown and black. Ordinary moles may be dark brown but are all one shade.
