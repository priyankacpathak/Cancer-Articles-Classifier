TITLE	Millions face serious health risks over lack of vitamin D in diets

Millions are at risk of developing serious health problems because of poor vitamin D levels, says a report. 

Only one in four is eating enough foods rich in vitamin D that can help stave off cancer, heart disease, diabetes and bone thinning. 

The obesity epidemic is making the shortfall worse, because the vitamin becomes trapped in body fat which prevents it circulating in the blood. 

Report author Dr Carrie Ruxton said there was 'worrying' evidence that adults and children could be at increased risk of chronic disease. 

She said: 'For a combination of reasons, the problem of vitamin D deficiency has probably never been worse'. 

The report, which reviews almost 170,000 patients in 140 studies, shows vitamin D plays an important role in combating serious health disorders. 

However, consumption of oily fish, eggs and butter spreads containing high vitamin D levels has dropped sharply says Dr Ruxton, an independent dietician, and Dr Emma Derbyshire of Manchester Metropolitan University. 

There are no recommended vitamin D levels in the UK, although the EU recommends a daily intake of 5 micrograms for 12 to 70-year-olds. 

The report, published in the Journal of the British Nutrition Foundation and funded by the Health Supplements Information Service, shows that in the UK 71 per cent of men and 78 per cent of women failed to reach this intake. 

Around 90 per cent of the body's supply of vitamin D comes from sunlight, but exposure is controversial as it can trigger skin cancer, said Dr Ruxton.
