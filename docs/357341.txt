TITLE	Curry cancer scare leads to spice recall

Last updated at 10:46 28 July 2005

Batches of curry powder have been withdrawn from sale after they were found to contain the banned dye Sudan 1, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) said today.

Rajah Premium Hot Curry Powder and Rajah Premium Mild Curry Powder have been taken off the shelves at Somerfield, Budgens and Kwik Save supermarkets.

Rajah is owned by BE International Foods, which has issued a recall notice for the affected products. However, the FSA is concerned that small retailers and caterers may still have the products on their shelves.

The affected powder was in 100g and 425g tins, with a best before date up to and including June 2008.

A 400g packet of the powder, with a best before date of June 2007, has also been withdrawn.

It is not the first time that Rajah has been implicated in the food scare. Eight of its products were found to contain Sudan 1 in 2003 and withdrawn from sale.

The FSA said it had notified local authorities who will ensure local shops do not carry the banned product.

Sudan 1 is a red dye normally used as a colouring in solvents, oils, waxes, petrol, and shoe and floor polish.

Experts have warned it could cause an increased risk of cancer although it is not thought to pose an immediate risk to health.

In February more than 400 products containing the dye were withdrawn from supermarket shelves in an exercise which is thought to have cost in excess of &pound;100million.

The FSA has published a list of 474 products thought to have been contaminated with the dye.

It has advised anyone who has any of these products at home to either throw them away or call HP Foods' customer helpline on 0800 072 4090 to arrange for a refund.
