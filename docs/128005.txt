TITLE	Can sunburn cause skin cancer?

You skin is probably itching because it has been damaged, and itching often occurs as part of the healing process - in the same way that wounds often itch as they are healing.

Itching can also be caused by dryness, so moisturize your skin at least twice a day with a non-perfumed moisturising lotion.

Anything containing perfume might irritate your skin, and make the itching even worse. Burning can increase the risk of skin cancer, especially melanomas, but they don't tend to develop straight away, but rather several years later.

 So you should keep an eye on yur skin for any odd brown marks, that enlarge, are crusted, or bleed. And you probably don't need me to say this - in future make sure you protect your skin in future by wearing a high factor sunblock (at least factor 20 or above) whenever you are out side, even if it's a cloudy day!
