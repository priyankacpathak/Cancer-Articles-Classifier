The cancer-risk food dye scare that led to more than 470 products being recalled will happen again, industry experts fear.

The crisis, which has cost an estimated &pound;100million, may be just the tip of the iceberg as Sudan 1 may have contaminated food for decades, they said.

Phil Lynas, boss of the company which makes Nando's sauces, said: "There will be another Sudan 1 problem within the next six months. And we will discover it has regularly been contained in foods for decades. I have no doubt about that."

The latest scare was caused by a batch of contaminated chilli powder from India.

It came to Britain three years ago and was then used in Worcester sauce, which is widely used as a flavouring.

Testing at the source

Another industry insider said: "This stuff has been milling around the trade for years so I very much doubt this will be the end of it.

"What about the dozens, maybe hundreds, of batches that were imported around the same time?"

Mr Lynas called for testing at source. "We already spend tens of thousands of pounds checking our products but we cannot test for everything," he added.
