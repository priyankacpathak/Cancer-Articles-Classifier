TITLE	Britain faces 'occupational cancer epidemic'

Last updated at 10:18 09 October 2007

The number of people dying from cancer contracted in the workplace could be four times higher than Government estimates, researchers have found.

The scientists from Stirling University said occupational cancer deaths could be around 24,000 a year - four times greater than the official estimate by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) of 6,000.

They said the Government failed to take account of new chemicals, new under-regulated industries and the number of women in work, according to the BBC.

The academics claim Britain is facing an epidemic of work-related cancers costing the economy at least &pound;29 billion a year, and the HSE's recommendations for action range "from complacent to non-existent".

The HSE acknowledges on its website that the system used to calculate the estimate needs further work and states: "Cancer is caused by a complex interplay of factors and as such it is difficult to assess the role of occupational exposures in its causation.

"Furthermore, many solid tumours have a latency of over 10 years and up to 25 years or even longer, making the association of disease with relevant occupational exposures particularly difficult to establish."

The HSE website says around 5,000 occupational cancer deaths occur in men and 1,000 in women.

Cancers contributing the largest number of estimated deaths in men are lung cancer (2,850), other and unspecified cancers (480), pleural and respiratory cancers (430), bladder cancer (310), leukaemia (230), and mesentery and peritoneal (180).

In women the only cancer contributing more than 100 estimated deaths is lung cancer (660).
