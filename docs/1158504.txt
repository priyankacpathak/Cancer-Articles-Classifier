A daily glass of wine could stave off cancer of the gullet, according to research. A study found those who enjoy a regular tipple more than halved their risk of developing Barrett's Oesophagus, an untreatable condition that can lead to oesophageal cancer. 

It is caused by prolonged heartburn and triggers precancerous cells in the tube that extends from the throat to the stomach. 

The study of almost 1,000 men and women found moderate consumption of red or white wine reduced the risk by 56 per cent but beer or spirits had no beneficial effects.

Gastroenterologist Dr Douglas Corley, of the Kaiser Permanente San Francisco Medical Centre, whose findings are published in Gastroenterology, said oesophageal cancer was the fastest growing cancer in the U.S. 

'Very little is known about its precursor, Barrett's Oesophagus,' he said. 'We are trying to figure out how to prevent changes that may lead to oesophageal cancer.'

'We already knew red wine was good for the heart, so perhaps here is another added benefit,' he added. 

It is not known why it works - one theory is the wine's antioxidants neutralise some harmful stomach acids. 

The researchers noted the protective effect of wine in terms of preventing Barrett's Oesophagus was greatest with one or two glasses a day. It did not increase with a higher intake. 

Last week, Oxford University scientists said women who had a daily glass of wine raised the risk of developing cancer by 25 per cent.
