TITLE	Herb tea fights breast cancer

Last updated at 11:15 09 August 2006

Drinking herbal tea can lower the risk of developing breast cancer.

Research based on 4,400 women who were monitored for more than six years shows that those who drank herbal tea more than halved the risk of developing the disease.

The women were all cancer-free at the start of the study, but by the end nearly 100 breast cancers had been diagnosed.

When their diets were analysed, it was found that those who had been drinking herbal teas, which are rich in antioxidants, had a 57 per cent lower risk than non-drinkers.

'The results suggest consumption of herbal tea may have a role in the prevention of breast cancer,' say the researchers for the French institute, Suppl&eacute;mentation en Vitamines et Min&eacute;raux Antioxydants.

The study also showed that drinking ordinary tea, coffee, fruit juice or wine is not linked with risk for developing breast cancer.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in Britain? one in nine women will develop the disease at some point in their lives.
