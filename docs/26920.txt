TITLE	The facts about cancer

Breast cancer is still the most common form of cancer in women. It is responsible for 11,500 deaths a year and 33,000 new cases are diagnosed annually.

Incidence has risen from 66 cases per 100,000 women in 1970 to around 107 per 100,000 now.

From the early 1980s, with improved screening and treatments, mortality rates began to decline and five-year survival is high at around 70 per cent.

Prostate cancer: is the second most common form of the disease among men in England and Wales.

Incidence has increased from 29 per 100,000 in 1970 to 60 per 100,000 now.

About 18,300 cases are diagnosed each year and there are 8,500 deaths. Around 40 per cent of British men are still alive five years after diagnosis. But in Europe, the average is 56 per cent while in the U.S. it is 87 per cent.

Lung cancer: is relatively rare at the beginning of the 20th century, is now the biggest cancer threat to men and the second biggest to women.

It affects 21,000 men and 12,300 women in England and Wales every year.

Five-year survival rates have hardly improved over the last 50 years, with just five per cent of sufferers living that long. Ninety per cent of cases are smoking related, but take 20 years to develop.

Bowel cancer: has been linked to a poor diet, high in fat and low in fruit and vegetables.

Physical activity may help reduce the risk of getting the disease, which kills 7,500 men and 7,100 women a year.

Incidence has been rising steadily over the past 30 years, but mortality rates have been falling thanks to earlier medical intervention and better treatments. Survival chances stand at 40 per cent five years after diagnosis.
