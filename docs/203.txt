TITLE	Blackberries

Pros: Blackberries are rich in the antioxidant anti-cancer vitamin E, which can help prevent damage to the arteries caused by free radicals and is vital for a healthy heart and circulatory system. They also have reasonable amounts of vitamin C, and provide enough soluble fibre in the form of pectin to help reduce the level of 'bad' cholesterol in the blood, thus cutting the risk of heart disease and strokes. Blackberries also contain good quantities of folic acid, which keeps blood healthy, and is essential for women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy because it protects against spina bifida in the developing foetus.

Cons: Anyone who is intolerant to aspirin may find they react to blackberries. This is because they contain aspirin-like compounds called salicylates which can cause an allergic reaction in sensitive people.
