TITLE	New food dye warning

Last updated at 08:57 17 March 2005

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a fresh alert over the potentially cancer-causing dye Sudan 1.

Tests have shown supermarket chain Asda's Flavours of the World Moroccan Chicken Pizza Flatbread has been contaminated with the illegal dye.

The company has withdrawn the product - which had a use by date of March 22 - from sale and advised anyone with one at home to contact their nearest store for a refund.

The FSA has begun an investigation but said it was thought to be unconnected to the recent Sudan 1 contamination of Crosse and Blackwell Worcester Sauce which led to Britain's largest product recall.

A total of 580 products were caught up on that occasion and a probe by the FSA is continuing.

The FSA said Asda had been supplied with the contaminated flatbread by Stateside Pizza, based near Bolton, Lancashire.

Risk is very small

The Sudan 1 was found in harissa spicy Moroccan sauce supplied to Stateside by Keddies Saucemasters, based in Newport, south Wales.

The FSA stressed the risk from the Sudan 1 in the product was very small but said it was sensible not to eat it.
