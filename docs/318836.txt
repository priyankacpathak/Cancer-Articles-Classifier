TITLE	Can brazil nuts help prostate?

Last updated at 18:21 22 September 2004

Selenium is an antioxidant which research shows may reduce the risk of a man developing prostate cancer. Eating a small handful of Brazil nuts every day will supply you with all the selenium you need, and though the nuts are high in fat you shouldn't worry about this becasue it's largely the healthy unsaturated kind that is good for the heart.

However I think the condition you are talking about is Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) a common enlargement of the prostate gland which is unrelated in any way to cancer or a precancerous condition.

To prevent a worsening in this condition (which increases the frequency of urination), two supplements that may help are a herb called saw palmetto and beta sitosterols - a group of plant based compounds that are similar in structure to cholesterol, without the cholesterol-raising effects.

In one double-blind trial involving 200 men, those with BPH who received 20 mg of beta-sitosterol three times a day had a significant improvement in urinary flow and an improvement in symptoms, whereas no change was reported in men receiving the placebo.

Neither of these supplements will add to your daily fat intake so you don't need to be concerned. To improve both your prostate and diabetic condition you'll also benefit from increasing the amount of exercise you teak - walking every day is ideal.
