TITLE	Big headed babies 'more prone to cancer'

Last updated at 14:24 10 December 2005

Babies born with large heads may be at an increased risk of childhood brain cancer, researchers have said.

Scientists in Norway investigated the incidence of brain tumours in more than a million people up to the age of 15.

From the sample, 453 children were diagnosed with brain cancer. The researchers found that for every centimetre increase in head circumference at birth, the relative risk of having a tumour rose by 27 per cent.

They said head circumference was unlikely to be a direct cause of cancer, but was probably associated with underlying causes.

One possible explanation was that hormones which affect body size also influence the development of cancer.

Another theory was that large children are more prone to cancer simply because they have more cells.

The study, published in the online edition of The Lancet medical journal, was based on birth records between 1978 and 1999.

Head circumference of babies has been measured in Norway since 1978. The records were compared with information from the Norwegian cancer registry over the same period.

Each individual was followed up to December 31, age 16, age at cancer diagnosis, or age at death - whichever occurred first.

The researchers concluded: "We have found a strong and consistent positive relation between head circumference at birth and brain cancer in childhood."

However there was no significant association between head size and the risk of other cancers. Previous research has linked exposure to X-rays in the womb with brain tumours.
