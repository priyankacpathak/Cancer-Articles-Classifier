TITLE	Cervical

There is no single determined cause of cervical cancer but researchers think that a particular strain of a sexually transmitted condition known as the human papilloma virus is almost certainly implicated.

Some studies suggest that sexual activity as a teenager with several partners makes the cervix vulnerable to cancer later in life. It is commonest among women over 50, but can affect any age group. Heavy smoking also seems to increase the risk.

Symptoms: In the early stages, the disease has no symptoms and can be detected only through a cervical smear test. This 'pre-invasive' stage, when the cells are changing to become pre-cancerous, can last many years. This is why smear tests can be so effective in spotting signs of trouble early.

Many women worry that an abnormal smear test means cancer, but only one in 500 tests shows even the possibility of cancer.

Depending on their severity, abnormal cells are removed under local anaesthetic. In the more advanced stages, the symptoms will be bleeding between periods and after intercourse. Post-menopausal women who experience bleeding must see their GP immediately.

Treatment: Pre-cancerous cells are removed using carbon dioxide laser, freezing, burning the tissue with an electric current or excision. Treatment of full-blown cancer depends on how far the disease has spread. It usually involves surgery - a radical hysterectomy - and radiotherapy, or both.
