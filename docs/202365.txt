TITLE	Psoriasis link to cancer

People with the skin disease psoriasis may have triple the normal risk of lymph cancer, scientists have revealed.

Doctors studied more than 2,500 psoriasis patients and more than 105,000 patients without the disease.

They found psoriasis sufferers had an almost three-fold higher rate of lymphoma.

But whether this was due to the skin disease itself, or its treatment, is unknown.

The American researchers, led by Dr Joel Gelfand, from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia looked at a group of British patients.

Over a period of about 46 months the researchers identified 276 cases of cancer.

Patients 65 years old or over were also more likely to develop lymphomas compared to the rest of the patients.

All were registered with a GP who contributed to a medical research database holding information on more than eight million people.

Psoriasis is characterised by patches of thickened, red and scaly skin. It affects about one to two per cent of the population.

Lymphomas are a group of cancers mainly found in the lymph nodes and the spleen.

The scientists now want to conduct further studies into whether the increased rate of lymphoma is related to psoriasis severity, psoriasis treatment, or a combination of them all.

The findings were reported in The Archives of Dermatology.
