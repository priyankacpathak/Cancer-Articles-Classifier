TITLE	Apples cut risk of heart or cancer death

An apple a day could cut the risk of dying from heart diseaseor cancer by 15 per cent, scientists claimed yesterday.

Research shows every 50 grams of fruit or vegetables eaten a day dramatically improves health. Low blood levels of vitamin C, in all fruit and vegetables, leads to heart attacks, strokes and some cancers.

People eating seven or eight 50 gram portions a day were healthiest in a study of 30,000 people in Norfolk. Professor Kay-Tee Khaw, of Cambridge University, said: 'Modest increases may be associated with large benefits.'
