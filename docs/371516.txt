TITLE	Tea could cut risk of ovarian cancer

Last updated at 09:29 13 December 2005

Drinking just two cups of tea a day could reduce the risk of ovarian cancer, research has suggested.

An extensive study found that women who drank two or more cups of tea a day had almost a 50 per cent lower risk of ovarian cancer compared with non-tea drinkers.

Various studies have indicated that green and black tea may provide protection from several types of cancer.

But this is one of the few studies that has specifically explored the relationship between tea consumption and the risk of ovarian cancer, which is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in UK women.

In the latest study, published in Archives of Internal Medicine, the Swedish researchers examined 61,057 women aged 40 to 76.

The women completed questionnaires about their eating and drinking habits between 1987 and 1990 and were followed up until December 2004 to see if they got cancer.

During the study a total of 301 women were diagnosed with ovarian cancer.

Researchers Susanna Larsson and Alicja Wolk said they saw a 46 per cent lower risk of ovarian cancer in women who drank two or more cups of tea per day compared with those who did not drink tea.

"Each additional cup of tea per day was associated with an 18 per cent lower risk of ovarian cancer," they added.

There was a 24 per cent lower risk for women who drank one cup a day.

Each year around 6,900 women in the UK are diagnosed with ovarian cancer, with more than 4,600 deaths annually.

According to Cancer Research UK, the majority of cases are diagnosed at a late stage and survival rates beyond five years are low.
