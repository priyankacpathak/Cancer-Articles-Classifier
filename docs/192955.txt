TITLE	The 10-second skin cancer test

A new 10-second test for skin cancer could revolutionise diagnosis of the disease and save lives.

Diagnosis: new test can detect skin cancer earlier

melanoma - the most dangerous form which kills 1,600 people a year in Britain - as well as other types of the disease.

Over the past 15 years, the number of cases of malignant melanoma has doubled, and among 20 to 34-year-olds it's the third most common cancer among women and the fourth most common in men.

The key to treatment is early diagnosis. The problem is that early melanomas closely resemble other conditions, such as benign pigmented skin lesions or moles.

The computer-based technology, developed by Astron Clinica, Birmingham University and Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, uses 12 different colours and wavelengths of light to investigate suspicious sites on the skin.

A handheld camera is focused on the lesion and rapidly takes a series of pictures at different wavelengths, ranging from blue to near infrared.

A computer processes the data in five seconds, converting it into colour-enhanced images of the mole on a laptop screen. Different colours show different types of skin factor, including levels of pigmentation, collagen and blood patterns.

It will, for example, show if there are high levels of melanin pigment deep under the mole - a high-risk factor for melanoma.

Bristol's Frenchay Hospital is involved in a trial looking at if the equipment, which costs around &pound;30,000, could be used for screening.

The technology could also help diagnose and monitor other conditions, including psoriasis and port wine marks.
