Women who exercise regularly can reduce their risk of breast cancer in later life - a time when they are most at risk, a study has found.

Higher levels of physical activity have been linked with a lower risk of the disease in those over 50.

The findings suggest exercise is especially effective against the more aggressive tumours which are fuelled by the oestrogen hormone, according to a report in the Archives of Internal Medicine.

Women who exercised vigorously by swimming, jogging or playing racket sports at least twice a week had a 14 per cent lower risk of breast cancer than those who rarely did any physical activity.

American researchers claim exercise helps by keeping women slimmer, which cuts down on the amount of cancerpromoting hormones produced by body fat.

Dr Aditya Bardia, of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, who led the study, said more research was needed to confirm the results.

Around 41,000 women develop breast cancer each year in Britain - most in the postmenopausal years after 50.

The latest research looked at the physical activity levels of 41,000 women between 55 to 69 taking part in the Iowa Women's Health Study.

The researchers found those with high physical activity levels based on the original survey had a 14 per cent lower risk of breast cancer compared with those with lower activity levels.

The most protection was gained against tumours fuelled by oestrogen, with high-exercising women having a 34 per cent lower risk.

British experts recommend women exercise moderately for 30 to 45 minutes five times a week to reduce their risk of breast cancer.
