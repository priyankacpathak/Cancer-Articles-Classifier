TITLE	Do implants increase your risk of breast cancer?

I can reassure you that breast implants, particularly silicone, actually decrease your risk of breast cancer.

On follow up studies in America (where the proportion of patients having implants is higher) studies have shown conclusively that ladies with silicone breast implants do not have a higher risk of breast cancer than the normal population.

However, the silicone does interfere with the mammogram (x-ray) examination of breasts, but this is less likely if they are put under the muscle on the chest wall.

Tell your nurse when you go for a mammogram and they can take x-rays from different angles to overcome the problem.

It is true to say that ladies with silicone breast implants have their breast cancer diagnosed later, but we are not yet sure of the reason for this.

Nonetheless, the overall prognosis, that is the outcome, is the same and therefore they do not present a danger to you with regard to breast cancer.

I am not quite sure why your saline implants should blow hot and cold - it may well be that there is a local injury to a nerve which responds to certain movements or hormonal change causing swelling of the breasts.

In some patients with silicone implants a feeling of burning in the breast can be a sign that the implant is leaking but this is obviously not the case with you.

 We are no longer accepting comments on this article.
