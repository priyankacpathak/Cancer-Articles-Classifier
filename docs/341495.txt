TITLE	Ketchup can perk up your pancreas

A chemical in tomato ketchup can prevent cancer of the pancreas, according to new research.

Tests show the chemical, called lycopene, can reduce the risk of the disease by almost a third if eaten regularly.

Lycopene - which has already earned a reputation as an effective agent against prostate cancer - is a powerful antioxidant that comes from the skin of tomatoes and gives them their red colour.

Scientists believe its disease-fighting properties can be best absorbed by the body when eaten in ketchup and other by-products. This is because ketchup is thought to carry high concentrations of lycopene as a result of the heating process used to produce it.

Meanwhile, oil in the sauce helps the intestines soak up the antioxidants. Pancreatic cancer affects around 3,600 people in the UK every year - almost all of them men.

Powerful effect

The disease is hard to detect because the pancreas is located deep inside the abdomen, and even when symptoms do appear, they can be quite vague, such as abdominal pain and weight loss. As a result, few people survive more than one year after diagnosis.

Although evidence suggests that eating fruit and vegetables may reduce the risk, the latest research on tomatoes points to a particularly powerful effect. Researchers at the universities of Montreal and Ottawa in Canada studied 462 cases of pancreatic cancer and compared the dietary habits of the cancer victims with 4,000 healthy people.

They found men who ate tomatoes and tomato products every day were 31 per cent less likely to get the disease. In women, the risk declined by nine per cent.
