TITLE	Worry 'increases risk of cancer'

People who are prone to worry are more likely to get cancer, according to research.

Psychiatrists found that people with a negative outlook on life may be up to 25 per cent more likely to develop the disease than those who take an optimistic view.

The findings, reported in New Scientist, will add to the controversy over whether psychological factors can trigger cancer.

Researchers at the University of Bergen in Norway tested 62,591 people over a twoyear period for anxiety and depression.

Some experts believe that stress, anxiety or depression all help to lower immune activity, allowing cancers to grow unchecked.

Meanwhile, British scientists are also investigating whether the power of positive thinking can help fight the disease.

The theory is being tested on 180 bowel cancer sufferers, in a study at the University of Hull funded by Cancer Research UK.
