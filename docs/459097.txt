TITLE	TV prize kidney 'carries a risk of cancer'

Last updated at 08:01 01 June 2007

The Dutch show has already received much criticism

Contestants hoping to win a kidney on a controversial TV show would run a high risk of contracting cancer if the transplant went ahead, a hospital has warned.

The Big Donor Show, by Big Brother production company Endemol, is being shown on Dutch TV.

It features a woman with terminal cancer identified only as Lisa, 37, who will watch video footage and hear testimony from three prospective recipients who want her kidney when she dies.

But doctors at the Amsterdam Medical Centre have said the kind of cancer the prospective donor reportedly suffers from makes a successful transplant "virtually impossible".

Hospitals in Holland have already said they would not get involved with the programme, which has been described as a "grotesque stunt".

Frederike Bemelman, a specialist at the centre, said: "In principle, cancer patients cannot apply to become donors. Sometimes there are exceptions but with high-grade tumours like the one this woman is said to be suffering from, the risk of spreading the cancer in a healthy body is too great."

Revulsion at the programme is spreading among ordinary Dutch people in a society famous for its tolerance and openness.

Three-quarters of readers of one daily newspaper said in a poll that they wanted to see the programme stopped.
