TITLE	'Morning after' sun cream to repair skin

A revolutionary &#39;morning after&#39; sun cream that could cut the number of skin cancer deaths has been developed by scientists.

Unlike conventional lotions, which only soothe and moisturise the skin, it contains a protein which actually repairs DNA damage caused by the sun&#39;s rays. The cream&#39;s makers hope that it will be used as part of a daily regime to protect against skin cancer.

But cancer charities warn it will encourage people to ignore sensible advice and stay in the sun too long. Skin cancer claims 2,000 lives in the UK every year and there are almost 70,000 new cases of the disease diagnosed annually. The cream, called Demericine, is based on a natural protein that increases the normal repair process.

It contains oil sacs that allow the protein to penetrate skin cells. Once inside, it removes damaged areas of DNA and starts the repair process.

Normal after-sun creams do not repair skin cells but soothe sore areas by moisturising them. Some also contain aloe vera which helps take away the pain.

The new lotion has been tested on 30 people with a rare genetic disease that makes them highly susceptible to skin cancer. Those who used it every day for a year had 30 per cent fewer skin cancers and 68 per cent fewer pre-cancerous lesions than those who used a placebo cream.

Dr Daniel Yaroush, president of the U.S. firm AGI Dermatics which developed the cream, told the American Chemical Society&#39;s annual conference in Washington that when it was tested on those without the condition the lotion appeared to prevent suppression of the immune system that can occur when people are exposed to too much UV radiation.

He said that the lotion was totally different from other sun creams as it was the first &#39;morning after lotion&#39; which can trigger DNA repair.

But Dr Yaroush added that it should not be used instead of normal sunscreen or as an excuse to stay out longer in the sun. &#39;People don&#39;t always use sunscreen when they should and just from going out and about they can get a significant amount of sun exposure over their lifetime,&#39; he said.

&#39;We are not advocating this as an alternative to sunscreen. It should be used alongside it as part of people&#39;s daily regime.&#39; The lotion is still undergoing clinical tests, but Dr Yaroush said it may be available by 2007. He added that it would cost about the same as existing lotions or face creams. &#39;We have not yet set any prices, but it would be within the reach of anyone,&#39; he said. &#39;If you could afford cosmetics you could buy this product.&#39;

But yesterday British cancer experts warned that a morning after cream could encourage people to stay out in the sun longer and risk sunburn. Derek Napier, chief executive of the Association of International Cancer Research, said that sunbathers will see the cream as a safety net and ignore advice about staying out in the sun for too long. He added: &#39;There are the same dangers with the morning after pill - people tend to think &#39;It doesn&#39;t matter because I can take this afterwards.&#39;&#39;
