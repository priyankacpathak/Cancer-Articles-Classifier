TITLE	'Prostate risk' in having a family, according to new study

Last updated at 22:19 06 January 2008

Having children puts men at a greater risk of developing prostate cancer, according to a study.

Analysis of the health records of more than a million men in Denmark indicates that fathers are 16 per cent more likely to develop the disease than childless men.

Researchers admit they are baffled - but believe something in the lifestyle of childless men protects them.

However, the same study found that having a large family appears to reduce the risk.

Fathers with six or more children were 43 per cent less likely to get prostate cancer later in life, than those with just one or two.

"This might reflect the fact that men who are able to have lots of children have healthier prostates," said Dr Morten Frisch, who took part in the study at the Statens Serum Institute.

Chris Hiley, of the Prostate Cancer Charity, said: "This is a bemusing piece of research from the Danes.

"It is difficult to envisage translating the results into any useful advice to give men keen to reduce their risk of prostate cancer."

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among British men: every year nearly 35,000 are diagnosed and 10,000 die from the disease.
