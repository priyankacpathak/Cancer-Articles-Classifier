TITLE	The anti-cancer cereal bar

A cereal bar has been specially formulated to increase cancer-fighting substances in the blood and thus help reduce the risk in the breast, ovaries, endometrium and prostate. The manufacturers also claim the bar can help with osteoporosis and menopause symptoms, and reduce cholesterol levels. The Preva pb bar contains soya beans and linseeds to boost levels of lignans and isoflavones.

In a recent trial, blood samples of ten British women were taken before and after eating one of these bars. Six hours after eating the bar, their levels had risen considerably.

So how exactly could isoflavones protect us against cancer? Dr Mike Morton, a chemist and specialist in cancer research at Bio-clinical Services International in Cardiff, says: 'Being plant oestrogens, they are able to interfere with oestrogen receptor sites. This prevents stronger oestrogens produced by the body from locking on to these sites, so the overall effect of oestrogen in the body is dampened down. 'This may help prevent development of breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer, which need oestrogen in their early stages for growth and development.'

Plant oestrogens in the form of soya have also been associated with relieving menopause symptoms and osteoporosis, and lowering cholesterol.
