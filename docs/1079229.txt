TITLE	Tiny diamond patch hailed as a breakthrough in fight against cancer

A tiny patch embedded with diamonds too small to be seen by the naked eye could be a new treatment for cancer. 

The patch, like a tiny piece of cling film, is placed around a tumour and the diamonds gradually release chemotherapy drugs directly into cancer cells. 

This means doctors can deliver the toxic drugs straight to the tumour, rather than exposing healthy tissue to their effects as with conventional chemotherapy. 

The breakthrough, by scientists at Northwestern University in Chicago, follows the discovery last year that so-called nano-diamonds provide the perfect vehicle for transporting chemotherapy drugs straight to cancerous growths.

This is because the diamonds, each one thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair, can be coated with a widely used chemotherapy drug called doxorubicin hydrochloride and then arranged into clusters. Each cluster comprises 25 to 50 diamonds. 

Because the clusters are made up of irregular-shaped diamonds, there is a large overall surface area that can be coated with medicine. Once in place, the flexible microfilm begins to slowly dissolve and the clusters of diamonds break up, releasing the anti-cancer cargo in the process. 

The tiny diamonds are then flushed out of the body in waste products produced by the liver and kidneys. Cancer affects an estimated one in three people in Britain at some point. 

Many end up needing chemotherapy but because the drugs can harm healthy as well as diseased cells, side-effects can include hair loss, nausea and increased risk from everyday infections because of the effects on the immune system.
