TITLE	Soft drinks linked to cancer

Last updated at 09:28 02 March 2006

Soft drinks sold in the UK have up to eight times the level of a cancer-risk chemical than is allowed in drinking water.

Benzene has been found in some of the best-selling brands, tests on 230 soft drinks found. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) called for the survey after concerning results in the US.

The chemical is a by-product of a reaction between two other ingredients commonly used to make drinks. It has been linked to leukaemia and other cancers of the blood.

Benzene is used to make glues, paints and detergents.

No legal limit for soft drinks

Although there is a legal limit of one part per billion in UK drinking water, there is no upper limit on the amount of benzene allowed in soft drinks.

The FSA downplayed any immediate health risks but Sustain, an alliance for better food and farming, said this was "wishful thinking."

"Benzene is a known cause of cancer," Richard Watts from Sustain said.

"The scientific evidence suggests we simply do not know how much Benzene can trigger cancer and so industry attempts to dismiss this issue are wishful thinking."

Mr Watts has called on the Government to introduce limits on Benzene in soft drinks: "The limit in drinking water is one part per billion. Why should this be any different for soft drinks?" he asked.
