TITLE	Cancer risk higher for women smokers

by JENNY HOPE, Daily Mail

Women smokers run a far higher risk of developing lung cancer than men, say doctors.

For each cigarette smoked, the danger is twice as high for women. And even non-smokers who develop lung cancer are two-and-a-half times more likely to be female than male.

Researchers claim the female sex hormone oestrogen could make women more vulnerable.

The discovery will intensify fears of a looming lung cancer epidemic as the number of young women smokers threatens to overtake male smokers. Smoking among teenage girls is one-third higher than boys.

In some parts of Britain, lung cancer has become the commonest cause of cancer death among women, beating breast cancer into second place and claiming 13,000 lives a year.

A new study, published today in The Lancet Oncology medical journal, examined a wide range of research into lung cancer risk in women.

US researcher Dr Jill Siegfried says the higher susceptibility of women to developing the disease is probably due to their higher levels of oestrogen. The hormone puts women at greater risk of other kinds of cancer, notably breast cancer, but it may also act in combination with cancer-causing environmental agents.

Last year, it was revealed that a gene that fuels lung cancer growth is more active in women than in men - putting them more at risk of developing the disease earlier and after smoking fewer cigarettes.
