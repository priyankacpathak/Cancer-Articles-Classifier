TITLE	Cancer fears over cod liver oil capsules

Last updated at 09:52 15 March 2006

Batches of cod liver oil tablets are being withdrawn from shop shelves because they have been contaminated by cancer-causing chemicals.

Seven Seas Ltd has recalled a number of its own-brand products which contain dioxin levels above the legal limit.

The move affects different sized pots of high and extra strength cod liver oil capsules, plus some "joint care" and "ProBrain" capsules.

Dioxins are by-products of industrial processes and are found in the environment including the sea. They are usually removed by health supplement manufacturers.

They have no immediate effect on human health but can cause problems if they are absorbed into the body at high levels for long periods.

The chemicals have been linked to cancer and can also harm unborn babies and damage the immune system.

No immediate risk

The Food Standard's Agency said consumers' health would not be put at risk from eating the recalled food supplements.

A spokesman said: "The Seven Seas products have slightly exceeded legal limits for dioxins in food but the levels reported in these products do not pose a risk to health."

Seven Seas has contacted the relevant retailers asking them to withdraw the affected batches from sale. The company said it had launched an investigation with its supplier
