TITLE	Allergies key to ovarian cancer

Scientists claim allergies could hold the key to a new treatment for ovarian cancer. They have discovered an antibody - produced by the body's defences during allergic reactions such as hay fever - which may be effective against cancer cells.

The discovery could help in the battle against ovarian cancer - affecting 6,000 women a year - which is known as the silent killer as it is often diagnosed too late for treatment to work.

Professor Hannah Gould of King's College in London said the breakthrough came after evidence showing that women who suffer from allergies have a lower risk of getting the disease. 'It is a statistically significant difference, although it is hard to quantify,' she says. But, as a result, work was carried out on an antibody called IgE which is an essential component in allergic disease alerting the defences against the allergen, whether it is pollen or dust mites.

Laboratory tests funded by the Cancer Research Campaign show that IgE also works against cancer by attaching itself to the cancer cells and, acting like a flashing beacon, alerts the body's immune system to the cancer. This causes the release of cancer-killing cells which target and attack the tumour.

Prof Gould says: 'Early indications show that by harnessing the body's natural defences, this antibody has the potential to stimulate the immune system into producing cells that are able to attack the cancer.
