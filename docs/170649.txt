TITLE	Aspirin may cut bowel cancer risk

A daily aspirin tablet could help prevent bowel cancer, say scientists.

Researchers at Dartmouth Medical School in New Hampshire found the drug reduced the risk of pre-cancerous polyps and cancer in the bowel among more than 1,000 patients with benign tumours.

Those who took a daily 'baby' dose of 80mg instead of a standard aspirin had the lowest rate of recurring polyps, according to the research published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Bowel cancer kills more than 16,000 people each year in Britain.
