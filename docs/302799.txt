TITLE	Get fruity to beat cancer!

Last updated at 10:38 14 May 2004

Health conscious Britons were today being encouraged to prevent the onset of cancer by eating more fruit.

The World Cancer Research Fund is launching "Fruity Friday" - a national public awareness campaign to promote the importance of a healthy diet.

Fund-raising events are due to be held across the country and collections will also be held at London Underground and rail stations in the capital.

Professor Martin Wiseman, medical and scientific adviser for the organisation's UK branch, said: "The causes of cancer are complex.

"Our landmark research has shown that for many cancers poor diet and lack of exercise can be significant contributory factors.

"These are parts of our lifestyle that are so easy to change - so we hope as many people as possible take up our Fruity Friday challenge and enjoy all the benefits of a healthier diet and lifestyle."

The message from the organisation is that people can reduce their risk of cancer by between 20 per cent and 40 per cent by introducing simple lifestyle changes - improving their diet by eating more fruit and vegetables, reducing their intake of fat and by watching their weight and doing more exercise.
