TITLE	Anxious women confused by smear tests

Last updated at 14:29 03 May 2006

Many women with only slightly abnormal smear tests falsely believe they have cervical cancer due to a lack of advice and assurance, experts claim.

A study looked at more than 3,500 women with slightly abnormal smear tests. These indicate changes in the cells which could lead to cancer in the future - but rarely means a woman already has cancer.

In the majority of cases, the cells return to normal in a few months without treatment and doctors check on the woman through a follow-up smear.

However, the scientists found 23 per cent of women had "probable causes" of clinical anxiety. These were similar to those felt by women whose screenings had revealed more definitive bad news.

Women at highest risk of feeling anxious tended to be younger with children.

Around 3,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed in the UK each year. Almost all are the result of infection by the human papilloma virus, for which a vaccine is being developed.

Misunderstanding

Lead study author Nicola Gray said: "Our results suggest women may not understand their test results or the meaning of the term pre-cancerous, and wrongly conclude that any abnormalities detected must indicate cancer."

The researchers said more needed to be done to inform women about what an abnormal smear means.

Martin Ledwick, cancer nurse manager at Cancer Research UK, said: "It's vitally important women understand that smear tests are all about cancer prevention.

"The national screening programme is estimated to save thousands of lives in the UK every year. But if women are worried unnecessarily by the results of their smear, the concern is they won't continue to go for regular checks."
