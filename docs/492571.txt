TITLE	Cancer risk from Pill 'lasts ten years'

Last updated at 16:54 09 November 2007

Taking the Pill can increase your chance of cervical cancer - but when you stop using it the higher risk drops away, scientists say.

The relationship between the Pill and cervical cancer is already known.

But the latest study shows that when women stop taking the combined oral contraceptive, the extra risk begins to fall.

And after ten years, it returns to normal levels, according to Cancer Research UK.

Spokesman Dr Lesley Walker said: "The link between the contraceptive pill and cervical cancer has been known for some time.

"This study helps us to quantify the increased risk and to understand how long the risk persists."

Cervical cancer risk peaks in those in their thirties, according to the research published today in the Lancet medical journal.

There is only a small overall effect on the lifetime risk of cervical cancer from young women's use of the Pill.

Previous research has also shown an increase in breast cancer risk in those who take the Pill, but a reduction in ovarian and womb cancer.
