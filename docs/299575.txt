TITLE	Breast checks 'do no good'

by LIZ HULL, Daily Mail

Women who regularly examine their breasts for cancerous lumps could be doing themselves more harm than good, according to research.

They almost always fail to detect real tumours but often endure needless intrusive tests and biopsies, which can lead to scarring, anxiety and depression.

The study by the World Health Organisation involved 122,000 women worldwide. It found no evidence that women who examined their breasts had a reduced risk of dying from breast cancer, but those women had 53 per cent more biopsies than those who did not self-examine.

Swedish Professor Lars Holmberg, who led the research, said the results proved women should undergo regular professional screening, rather than relying on self-examination.

"My advice to women is to simply be aware of your body and any cancer-like symptoms and seek professional screening and advice,' he said.

UK has high rate of breast cancer

The UK has one of the highest breast cancer death rates in the world. Each year more than 40,000 women in Britain are diagnosed with breast cancer and 13,000 die.

Regular breast screening is available on the NHS only for women aged between 50 and 64.

While the Department of Health no longer actively promotes self-examination, women are not discouraged from doing so.

However, in light of this new evidence experts say this may have to be reviewed.

Debbie Hutchings, of Cancer Research UK, said: "We encourage women to be breast aware, and if they spot a change they must go to their doctor, but that is quite different to saying that on a given day of the month you should examine your breasts."
