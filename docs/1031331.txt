TITLE	Children under 16 are 'defying skin cancer risk by topping up tans with sunbeds'

Tens of thousands of under-16s have used a sunbed despite warnings of the risk of developing skin cancer, research suggests. 

A survey of 872 children aged 11 to 16 found that 6 per cent had used a sunbed, 75 per cent of them girls, with almost half using unsupervised coin-operated booths.

 

The study, presented yesterday at the British Association of Dermatologists conference in Liverpool, found of the under-16s who used sunbeds 18 per cent did so at least once a week and 41 per cent did so at least once every three months. 

Of the child sunbed users, 25 per cent admitted to burning easily and 30 per cent had freckles - factors that increase the risk of skin cancer. 

Malignant melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer, is the most common cancer in 15 to 34-year-olds, resulting in 9,000 cases and 1,800 deaths a year. 

Researcher Dr Ravi Suchak, dermatologist at Barts and The London NHS Trust, said: 'Our findings indicate that a significant number of schoolchildren use artificial tanning devices. 

'Tougher licensing and regulation of tanning salons, and a restriction on unstaffed, coin-operated devices is overdue.'
