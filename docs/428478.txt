TITLE	Eating tofu can slash ovarian cancer risk

Last updated at 23:28 12 January 2007

Eating tofu regularly can almost halve a woman's chances of developing ovarian cancer, according to researchers.

A study found that a daily portion of 10gm of the food, a meat substitute made from soya bean curd, cut the risk by 44 per cent.

This level of consumption releases around 3mg or more of isoflavones, the plant hormones in soya believed to protect against some forms of cancer and heart disease.

The benefit also came from other products from the soya plant, including soya fortified milk and dairy products.

However, diet in general had little impact on the disease, with dairy products, fruit and vegetables or tea not affecting the risk, added the study.

Scientists from the Northern California Cancer Centre carried out the research involving 100,000 active and retired teachers.

In total, 280 cases of ovarian cancer were diagnosed.

Each year, 6,000 women are diagnosed with the disease in the UK.

Claire Williamson, of the British Nutrition Foundation, said a small tofu-based meal or a drink of soya milk would provide 3mg of isoflavones.
