TITLE	Herb could prevent ovarian cancer

Last updated at 12:59 11 November 2005

The herbal supplement Ginkgo biloba may help lower the risk of developing ovarian cancer, a study has found.

Ovarian cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in women and the second most commonly diagnosed gynecologic cancer.

Herbal supplements such as ginkgo have generated interest for their potential preventive effects.

But there had so far been a "lack of scientific evidence" to support their use for this purpose, according to Dr. Bin Ye from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.

However in a population-based study involving more than 600 women with ovarian cancer and 640 healthy control women, Ye and colleagues found that of the most commonly used herbals including Echinacea and St. John's Wort, ginkgo was the one supplement that had an actual effect.

According to the data, women who took ginkgo supplements had a 60 percent lower risk of ovarian cancer.

Dr Ye said: "4.2 per cent of ovarian cancer-free women reported taking ginkgo regularly for at least six months before diagnosis, but only 1.6 percent of women with ovarian cancer reported taking ginkgo."

"This suggests that women who are using ginkgo may be less likely to develop ovarian cancer."

Studies conducted in the laboratory provide evidence that ginkgolide A and B - key components of ginkgo biloba - are largely responsible for this protective effect.

In the laboratory study, Ye and colleagues treated ovarian cancer cells with a low dose of ginkgolide for 72 hours. This led to up to an 80 percent reduction in the growth of the ovarian cancer cells.

"To conclude, Ginkgo biloba may decrease the risk of ovarian cancer in the general population," Ye said.
