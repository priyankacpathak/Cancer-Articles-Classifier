Professional middle aged women are being targeted as part of a &pound;10million anti-drinking campaign. Posed by model.

Middle-aged women are to be targeted in an anti-drinking campaign warning about the increased risk of breast cancer and liver disease.

The &pound;10million initiative will focus on those aged 30 to 50 whose alcohol-related problems often go unnoticed

Dawn Primarolo, the Public Health Minister, said she wanted to focus on women aged 30 to 50, whose drink-related problems often go unnoticed.

She said: &quot;I&#39;m concerned that a lot of women are drinking much more than they think they are and that it&#39;s damaging and hurting them in terms of their health.

&quot;These are women who may think that one glass of wine equals one unit.

&quot;But with the increased strength of wine and large size of glasses these days, it could be anything from one and a half units up to three and a half units, if it&#39;s a large glass of Rioja.

&quot;The health warnings will be quite stark and they need to be quite stark.

&quot;We want to ensure that women know the consequences of drinking, and know more about units so they can decide how much they are going to drink.&quot;

The campaign, expected to be launched in the spring, aims to inform the public about how much they are actually drinking and cut the number of alcohol related hospital admissions.

It will give clear information about how many units are in alcoholic drinks and aims to challenge perceptions that say it is &quot;all right to be drunk&quot;.

Although women will be a prime target of the campaign, it will be aimed at every drinker.

The new campaign comes amid new demands from ex-Labour Health Secretaries for increased taxes to tackle binge drinking.

Patricia Hewitt, Health Secretary from 2005 to 2007, said she had pleaded with the Treasury for higher alcohol duty &quot;at every Budget&quot;.

She said: &quot;Alcohol in real terms is a great deal cheaper than it was 20 years ago and when young people have so much more money to spend, there&#39;s no doubt it is a contributing factor.&quot;

Frank Dobson, Tony Blair&#39;s first Health Secretary in 1997, said there was &quot;clearly a good case for increasing the general level of taxation on alcohol&quot; - and on alcopops in particular.

Alan Milburn, also an ex-Health Secretary, said the government should first attempt to strike a deal with retailers on a sensible pricing of alcohol, but added: &quot;Short of that, I don&#39;t think we should rule out changes in taxation.&quot;
