TITLE	Can diet changes help an abnormal smear?

Very often slight abnormalities in smear tests return to normal without any treatment at all. It is important to remember that smear tests detect the early warning changes that might lead to cervical cancer if left untreated.

These abnormalities are sometimes called mild dyskaryosis, inflammatory changes or HPV (human papilloma virus).

You have mentioned the fact that you are a non-smoker, which is important, as smoking is known to increase the risk of changes developing and progressing to a stage where they will require treatment.

There is nothing specific that you can do at the moment to help the smear test return to normal. If it does come back as abnormal a second time, your GP will suggest you are referred to the colposcopy clinic at the hospital.

This is an outpatient appointment, where a gynaecologist will take a closer look at the cervix to check specifically for abnormalities known as CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia).

If treatment is needed, this can also usually take place as an outpatient and a variety of methods are available depending upon the severity of the abnormality and the local clinic protocol. These include freezing, heat treatment, laser or excision (loop biopsy).
