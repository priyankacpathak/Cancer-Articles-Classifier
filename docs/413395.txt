TITLE	Sticking plaster that tackles cancer

Last updated at 13:16 30 October 2006

A "sticking plaster" that tackles skin cancer by using a battery-powered light has been developed by British scientists.

The hi-tech patch could allow patients to be treated in GP surgeries or at home.

The technology is an adaptation of a treatment known as photodynamic therapy, which is already used on skin cancer patients.

During the therapy, the affected area of skin is covered with a light sensitive anti-cancer cream.

This is then activated by controlled exposure to a light source.

However, existing systems use large, cumbersome and intense light sources in hospital.

The patient must sit or lie still under the light for several hours in a special cubicle.

The "sticking plaster" does the same job but is small, light and portable.

Professor Ifor Samuel, of the University of St Andrews, one of two Scottish scientists who developed the patch, said: "It can be worn by the patient in a similar way to a sticking plaster, while the battery is carried like an iPod."

His colleague Prof James Ferguson, head of the photobiology unit at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, added: "This new device will have a major impact on the treatment of skin cancers."

"The light-emitting patch is a low-cost, portable and convenient method of treatment."

"Our initial pilot trials have already shown its effectiveness and we find patients requesting this treatment over conventional methods."

He said the patch should allow more patients to be treated, and opens up the possibility of treatment in GP surgeries and people?s homes.

Like other forms of photodynamic therapy, the "sticking plaster" treatment is only suitable for less serious non-melanoma cancers near the surface of the skin.
