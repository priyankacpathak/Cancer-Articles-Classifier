TITLE	Overweight young adults risking cancer

Young adults who are overweight significantly increase their risk of dying of cancer in later life, according to a study published today.

Researchers monitored more than 10,500 students at the University of Glasgow who used the student health service between 1948 and 1968.

The study published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health today, found that up to the year 1997 a total of 971 men and 138 women had died and of these 339 men and 82 women died of cancer.

In men the risk of death from cancer increased by 22% for every additional five kilogrammes (11lbs) of weight but in women the equivalent increase was 43%.

Altogether 261 deaths were from cancers not related to smoking.

Even after taking into account factors known to influence the risk of death from these cancers such as height, number of siblings and the age the women's menstruation began, weight still had a significant impact on risk.

The researchers from Bristol University found every additional 5kg of weight pushed up the risk of dying from cancers not linked to smoking by 36% in men and by 80% in women.

The risks of breast and prostate cancer were significantly higher in heavier women and men compared to those of normal weight.

The authors, led by Dr Mona Okasha of Bristol University, conclude that weight during adolescence has lasting implications for the risk of dying from cancer in later life.

"The increasing prevalence of childhood obesity may result in increased cancer mortality in future years," they said.
