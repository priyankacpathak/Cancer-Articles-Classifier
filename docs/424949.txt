TITLE	Daily dose of olive oil 'cuts risk of cancer'

Last updated at 11:39 30 December 2006

Four teaspoons of olive oil a day can help protect against cancer, scientists claim.

A study of 182 European men found a diet rich in olive oil reduced levels of chemicals in the blood which can trigger cancer.

The Danish team said it could explain why many cancer rates are higher in northern Europe than in the south, where olive oil is a major part of the diet.

Researchers at Copenhagen University Hospital measured levels of 8-oxodG - a substance which indicates damage to cells - in men's urine.

After taking olive oil the men were found to have around 13 per cent less.

Scientists found that those who had 25 millilitres (0.9 fluid oz) of olive oil per day had reduced levels.

They added either virgin, common or refined olive oil to their diets over two weeks.

Dr Henrik E Poulsen, of Rigshospitalet, Denmark, who led the study, said: "Every piece of evidence so far points to olive oil being a healthy food. By the way, it also tastes great."

A diet rich in olive oil, combined with fruit, vegetables and carbohydrates such as wheat pasta, has been cited as contributing to higher life expectancy rates in Mediterranean countries.

Dr Anthea Martin, of Cancer Research UK, said the results should be viewed with a degree of caution.

She said: "More long-term research is needed to confirm these effects. The effect of diet on cancer risk is very complex because of the many different components of the food we eat. We do know that a healthy, balanced diet... can help reduce the risk of cancer."
