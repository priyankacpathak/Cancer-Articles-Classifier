TITLE	Cancer: the facts

A relatively rare cause of death in the early 1900s, for either men or women. But boys born in those years, and before, took up smoking in their thousands during World War I, with terrible consequences for their health. The peak rate of mortality was reached in 1974, at 162 deaths per 100,000.

In women, a similar effect occurred after World War II, when it became acceptable for them to light up in public. Their epidemic of lung cancer peaking during 1989, at 44 deathers per 100.000.

Death rates ahve fallen among men since the 1970s, as the anti-smoking message has hit home.

But the rate of lung cancer cases among women of 35 to 49 has not improved for the last 20 years.

Cervical cancer

Linked to sexually transmitted diseases, it had three peaks during the last century.

They clearly reflected greater sexual activity during the two world wars, and the advent of the contraceptive pill and the 1960s sexual revolution.

The death rate in women of 15 to 34 halved between 1987 and 1994, possibly due to fear of Aids promoting safer sex practices.

Breast cancer

Rates rose steadily throughout the century, possibly due to lifestyle and diet changes which in turn affected women's hormone levels.

Specialists point to the fact that girls have started menstruating earlier, while older women are having fewer pregnancies and delaying motherhood to pursue careers.

All these change hormone levels and may add to the cancer danger. Other risk factors may include the consumption of high-fat diets and alcohol, both of which have increased over the past century.

In 1910, just over 80 women in every 100,000 died of breast cancer but by 1988 this figure had shot up to 120 per 100,000.

Years of research have now dramatically improved survival chances, and death rates went into a steep decline during the 1990s, back to the Edwardian levels.

Skin cancer

Risks of malignant melanoma grew for each successive 20th Century generation.

There was a surge linked to the increase in numbers of foreign holidays taken in the 1950s and 1960s.

Someone born in 1965, for example, has a 50 per cent greater risk than someone born in the 1930s. Deaths from skin cancer are now at an all-time high among the over 75s.
