TITLE	Illegal dye found in more food products

Last updated at 17:24 06 May 2005

The potentially cancer-causing chemical dye - similar to the notorious Sudan 1 - is used in food spices.

On Thursday the FSA announced that 35 products made with cayenne pepper found to contain Para Red were being taken off the shelves.

The Agency said the products identified today were made using the same batch of contaminated spices, supplied by Lion Foods in the UK.

The new latest products to be withdrawn include pates made by Castle MacLellan, Somerfield cooking sauces and Weight Watchers pates.

The food products being withdrawn contain very low levels of the illegal dye.

Although the risk posed by the affected foods was small, the FSA warned it was "sensible" to avoid eating them.

Dr Andrew Wadge, director of food safety at the FSA, said: "Para Red like Sudan 1 is an illegal dye that should not be in food.

"People understandably don't expect or want it to be in their food. At the levels being found the risk is likely to be very small indeed, but it is right that food businesses are removing these products from sale."

People who have any of the contaminated products at home can contact the manufacturer or the store where they bought it for a refund.

Para Red is an industrial dye that is not permitted for use in food. It is used legitimately in printing ink.

It is chemically similar to Sudan 1, a dye implicated in the contamination of other food products in February.

The contaminated spice - believed to originate in Uzbekistan - was supplied by the Spanish company Ramon Sabater.
