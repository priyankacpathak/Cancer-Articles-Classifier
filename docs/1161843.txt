Drinking a pint of beer a day could raise the risk of prostate cancer, warn researchers. 

They found two or more drinks a day increased the likelihood of developing the disease by 20 per cent. However that level is within the Department of Health's 'safe' limits for men. 

The findings come from a review of 35 studies looking at the relationship between levels of drinking and the risk of developing prostate cancer.

Previous research said the evidence was 'inconclusive' but scientists at Curtin University in Australia say their study was large enough to uncover a link. 

They point out older men may expect moderate drinking to protect them from heart disease. 

But at the same time they could be increasing their risk of prostate cancer, says a report in the journal Molecular Nutrition and Food Research.

 

The review included all studies published in or before 2006. 

It shows heavier drinkers - 14 or more drinks a week - are about 20 per cent more likely to develop prostate cancer. 

The report states: 'These findings emphasise the value for men to drink moderately.' 

In the UK, alcohol accounts for 6 per cent of cancer deaths, killing more than 9,000 a year. 

Dr Jodie Moffat, of Cancer Research UK, said 'The more you cut down on alcohol, the more you can reduce your cancer risk.'
