TITLE	My cough won't go away - should I have a chest x-ray?

There is no straightforward answer to this. It all depends on the age of the person, and also on any other symptoms - if any - they may have. X-rays do expose the body to a small amount of radiation, and cumulative exposure can increase, very slightly, the risk of cancer.

That means that although the radiation from a single chest X-ray is exceedingly small, it should still only ever be done for a good reason.

In general, chest X-rays should only be done if there is a suspicion that a persistent cough is due to a severe infection (such as pneumonia or TB), or due to swollen glands inside the chest, or if there is a worry the person may have cancer.

In young people, viral illnesses or even asthma can cause a persistent cough for several weeks, but if the person is otherwise well, there is no need to do an X-ray. But if a person is unwell, or has chest pain, and antibiotics have not been helpful, then it would be reasonable to do a chest X-ray. And an X-ray should certainly be done fairly quickly in an elderly person who is a heavy smoker, who has lost weight and is coughing up blood.

 It sounds as though you are worried that someone you know (or even you) are concerned about chest symptoms, and wonder whether you should have an X-ray done. The only thing to do is go and discuss it with your GP.
