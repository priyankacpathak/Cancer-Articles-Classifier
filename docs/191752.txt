TITLE	Combined HRT users `at risk of cancer`

Doctors and GPs' surgeries across Britain have received advice on how to reduce panic among women taking hormone replacement therapy after a massive study revealed a significantly increased risk of breast cancer.

Researchers found that using the combined oestrogen-progestagen treatment - the most common form of HRT - doubled women's risk of developing breast cancer compared with those not taking HRT.

The Million Women Study also confirmed an increased risk of 45% for users of tibolone and 30% among those using oestrogen-only HRT.

About 1.5 million women in the UK are currently using HRT, with about half that number taking the combination treatment.

The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM), which advises the Government on the quality of drugs, has provided advice to all healthcare professionals in light of the research.

The Government is keen for women not to panic, saying they should make a routine appointment to discuss their treatment with their doctor.

The CSM is urging GPs to assess each case individually and says the study's results "do not necessitate any urgent changes to women's treatment".

But one Dutch researcher, writing alongside the results of the study published in The Lancet, said women should "discontinue HRT use as soon as possible".

But the Cancer Research UK team which carried out the study and the CSM stepped back from this position, instead saying women should be told of the risk and reassessed regularly.

Despite this thousands of women were expected to flock to their GPs or call the NHS Direct advice line after hearing the results of the study.
