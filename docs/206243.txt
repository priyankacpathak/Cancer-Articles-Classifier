TITLE	Skiers warned of cancer risk

Winter sports fans were today warned to remember that they face as big a danger from skin cancer as sun-worshippers heading for the beach.

The British Skin Foundation (BSF) said that many skiers and snowboarders were unaware of the high risk of sunburn due to UV radiation being more severe in alpine regions than at sea level.

The warning follows an alarming increase in skin cancer cases in recent years, with almost 7,000 new cases diagnosed in 2000 - up 24% compared with 1995.

While most holidaymakers heading to popular sun destinations are aware of the need to wear protection against UV rays, the same cannot be said for those going to the ski slopes.

The BSF said that the amount of UV rays reaching the earth's surface increases by up to 5% for every 1,000ft above sea level you go.

This means that a mountain 10,000 feet high received 50% more UV exposure that a beach at sea level.

The organisation also pointed out that water was very good at reflecting rather than absorbing UV radiation, meaning rays bounce off snow and ice in all directions, penetrating even thick clouds and fog.

They said that depending on how old the snow was, around 50-90% of UV radiation was reflected, putting areas such as the shin and tip of nose at risk of dangerous sunburn.

Consultant dermatologist Colin Holden said it was crucial that those enjoying holidays in the snow remembered to use sun cream on their head, face, ears and neck - areas commonly affected by skin cancer tumours.

"Participation in winter sports has been increasing but research has shown people often don't think of sun protection in the winter. "Alpine skiers should protect all exposed areas with sunscreen with a sun protection factor of at least 30," he said.
