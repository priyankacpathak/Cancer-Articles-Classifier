Women who exercise regularly can cut their risk of breast cancer by a third, say researchers.

Those who swim, jog or do aerobic sports for more than five hours a week have a lower risk, they found.

The risk of early-stage breast cancer was cut by 31 per cent and there was a 20 per cent drop in invasive cancer cases.

"A woman's long-term exercise habits are important in determining her future breast cancer risk," said Professor Leslie Bernstein, of the University of Southern California.

"It confirms that breast cancer risk is influenced by consistent participation in strenuous forms of exercise."

The research, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, looked at 110,00 women aged 22 to 79. During the decade-long study 2,649 were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and 593 with early stage cancer.

The risk of both types was reduced among those doing five or more hours of exercise a week. Keeping fit also protected against non-hormone sensitive invasive cancers.

In four out of five cases, breast cancer is fuelled by the female hormone oestrogen and can be treated with drugs.

However, up to 20 per cent of cases are not hormone sensitive and regular vigorous exercise may be part of the answer.

In the UK around 41,000 women develop breast cancer each year and 13,000 die.

Experts recommend women take 30 to 45 minutes exercise five times a week to reduce their risk.

Liz Carroll, head of clinical services for Breast Cancer Care, said: "Evidence is emerging pointing to the potential benefits exercise may have in reducing the risk of breast cancer.

"However, more research is needed."
