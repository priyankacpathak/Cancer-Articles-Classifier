TITLE	The friendship cure

Friends can help women beat breast cancer, researchers say.

A study found survival rates were dramatically higher among victims with a wide circle of supportive friends.

U.S. researcher Dr Karen Weihs asked women diagnosed with the disease to list those outside their home they could rely on for help or support in times of trouble.

The lists varied between two and ten, with an average of six. Dr Weihs, who called her results 'remarkable', found that survival odds grew as the number of close friends went above six.

She believes that feelings of security may calm women and lower their production of stress hormones.

As the hormones drop, immune function improves and the body is able to fight the cancer more effectively, said Dr Weihs, of the George Washington University Medical Centre in Washington.

This lowers both the risk of death and the chance of the cancer recurring.

In the UK, the study received a cautious welcome from Kate Law, head of clinical programmes at the Cancer Research Campaign. But she called for more extensive research.
