TITLE	Vegetarian diet proved to fight disease

Vegetarians are less prone to cancer and heart disease because their diets are rich in an acid which combats the hardening of arteries, scientists have found.

The high levels of salicylic acid in fruit and vegetables may explain why fewer vegetarians die of heart disease and bowel cancer.

The acid is the main component of aspirin - widely prescribed by doctors to reduce the risk of heart attacks - and even small quantities have been shown to fight the inflammation which causes most cardiovascular illness.

Researchers in Scotland found that levels of salicylic acid in the blood of vegetarians were up to 12 times higher than in meat eaters.

Dr John Paterson, a consultant at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary, helped conduct the research, published today in the Journal of Clinical Pathology.

He said: 'The benefits of fruit and vegetables are proven, but we haven't yet discovered what exactly makes them so good for you. We think salicylic acid is one of several compounds they contain which combat heart disease.'

Dr Paterson said further trials are needed to prove the benefits of salicylic acid - but that the effectiveness of aspirin in preventing heart disease indicates that fruit and vegetables could have similar health benefits.

'When you take an aspirin tablet, your body turns it into salicylic acid - it's the main component of aspirin,' he said. 'We aren't saying fruit and veg are as good a source, just that a high dietary level of salicylic acid may produce some of the same good effects.'

Dr Paterson said there is evidence aspirin can also guard against bowel, breast and lung cancer, as well as Alzheimer's disease. 'It may be that salicylic acid in the diet can help prevent these diseases,' he added.
