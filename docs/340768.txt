TITLE	Passive smoking linked to breast cancer

Last updated at 13:15 10 March 2005

Passive smoking causes breast cancer, particularly in younger women, according to a new report.

The study is one of the first to suggest that smoke is a cause of the disease, which affects one in nine women.

It found that women exposed to second-hand smoke have up to a 90 per cent greater risk of developing breast cancer.

Scientists analysed exposure to second-hand smoke and more than 1,000 studies on its health effects.

The findings challenge the majority of studies which have found no connection between female smokers and breast cancer.

Experts believe the 1,200-page report, commissioned by the Californian Air Resources Board, could have a significant impact on cancer research and anti-smoking laws.

However, the report did not estimate the number of additional new breast cancer cases or calculate the risk based on actual doses of second-hand smoke.

Laboratory tests have already found that chemicals from cigarettes cause breast cancer in animals but until now major public health groups have not linked the two in humans.

The report comes just days after Japanese scientists published a report which found that both smoking and passive smoking increased the risk of breast cancer in pre-menopausal women more than threefold.
