TITLE	Mothers are unaware of cancer protection from breastfeeding

 Most mothers are unaware that breastfeeding their babies can protect them against cancer, according to a poll out today.

 

 There is now 'convincing' evidence that breastfeeding lowers a mother's risk of developing breast cancer, according to the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF), which carried out the survey. 

 Yet 75 per cent of women across Britain do not know that breastfeeding can help prevent the disease. 

Two-thirds of women were also unaware that being breastfed cuts a child's chances of being overweight - a risk factor for cancer. 

Men were even less aware of the benefits of breastfeeding, with just 13 per cent knowing it cuts a mother's risk of breast cancer. 

 And only 17 per cent of men knew of the link between breastfeeding and reducing a child's chances of being overweight. 

A study published in January by the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) found 'convincing' evidence that breastfeeding lowers the risk for both pre- and post-menopausal breast cancer. 

 The AICR's expert panel reviewed data from 98 studies to reach their conclusions. 

Lucie Galice, general manager of the WCRF, said of today's poll: "It is a real concern that so many women are unaware that breastfeeding can help prevent cancer. 

"But the evidence on this is convincing and this is why we recommend that, if they are able to, mothers aim to breastfeed exclusively for the first six months and then continue with complementary feeding after that." 

She added: "Many new mothers are making choices about whether to breastfeed without knowing it can help reduce cancer risk for both them and their child. 

"It is clear we have a lot of work to do to raise awareness about the link between breastfeeding and cancer prevention because it is important that when it comes to deciding whether to breastfeed, women are in a position to make an informed choice." 

Among both men and women, 19 per cent of the 1,998 people surveyed thought breastfeeding reduced a mother's risk of cancer, while 25 per cent thought it reduced a child's risk of being overweight. 

There were regional variations, with 16 per cent of Londoners saying breastfeeding helps protect the mother, while 23 per cent said it reduced a child's risk of being overweight. 

In the rest of the South, the Midlands and Wales, the figures were 19 per cent and 26 per cent respectively, while in the North, the figures were 19 per cent and 24 per cent respectively. 

In Scotland, 28 per cent of people asked knew breastfeeding cut the risk of breast cancer, while 28 per cent said it cut the chances of a child being overweight.
