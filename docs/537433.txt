Smarter: New research has shown having a baby can make women as brainy as Einstein

Having a baby makes you brainier ? that was the rather surprising finding from an American study published earlier this month.

While in the first three months, &quot;mumnesia&quot; may mean she leaves her shopping in the supermarket car park and puts her handbag in the fridge ? as one mother I knew did ? the researchers found that in the long term, a mum&#39;s memory and ability to multi-task improves.

In fact, it&#39;s just one of a number of physical benefits that having a baby brings to mothers ? and sometimes fathers.

But there are also the health downsides. Here, from the brain to the waistline, are some of the good ? and bad ? things about having children.

Smarter brain

Doctors call it &quot;maternal amnesia&quot; but it is more commonly referred to as &quot;mumnesia&quot; or &quot;nappy brain&quot; ? anyway, whatever it&#39;s called, you know you&#39;ve got it when you put your car keys in the cat&#39;s bowl.

Men&#39;s jokes about nappy brain are similar to those about the &quot;time of the month&quot;. And yet new US research says that &quot;nappy brain&quot;, although it exists, is a short-term phenomenon, probably due to sleep deprivation.

Previously, it was thought the cause was brain shrinkage ? one study found that a pregnant woman&#39;s brain shrinks by up to seven per cent.

But while argument rages about the cause, Allen Snyder, a leading Australian neuroscientist, says &quot;women&#39;s memory is not reduced during pregnancy ? rather, their attention is on things that are more immediately crucial&quot;, such as keeping that baby alive!

He described a woman&#39;s brain as being like Albert Einstein&#39;s; Einstein used to forget where he had put large cheques because he was a tad busy working out the theory of relativity.

American research on pregnant rats supports the idea that women who have had children are actually cleverer. It suggests that the hippocampus, the area of the brain responsible for memory, learning and emotion, might actually grow more neuron connections during pregnancy to accommodate an increasingly demanding environment.

Perhaps that&#39;s why a mother can load a washing machine, feed mush into a little mouth and tell her other half what he forgot to buy at the supermarket, all at the same time.

Motherhood also gives women a more acute sense of sight. An American study found pregnant women massively outperformed non-pregnant ones in visual perception tests ? usually a skill associated with men. It&#39;s thought acute vision helps perceive threats to your offspring.

This sounds surprising ? after all, the arrival of a first baby can be an especially difficult time. &quot;Having to reorientate as a mother is very stressful,&quot; explains Martina Clett-Davies, sociologist and research fellow at the London School of Economics.

And it&#39;s not just women who feel the stress of new parenthood. &quot;Men go though this, too,&quot; says Clett-Davies. &quot;Many feel hard-done-by and ignored. At least women are recognised as mothers.&quot;

However, it&#39;s not the amount of stress that matters, but how you deal with it. Of course, there are those who suffer from the serious problem of post-natal depression (some estimates put this at as many as one-in- ten new mothers).

Motherhood benefits: Having a baby can lower the risk of cancer and reduce stress

However, new research says most new mothers might actually be less stressed than non-mothers. The reason is oxytocin, a hormone produced by both men and women, but which women make more of to stimulate labour and breast milk.

Oxytocin is a sort of natural anti-depressant, it inhibits the release of stress hormones.

The good news: &quot;Having children affects a woman&#39;s risk of developing cancers, in most cases beneficially,&quot; says Lucy Boyd, UK epidemiologist at Cancer Research. The risk of breast cancer drops by seven per cent with each birth; the risk for ovarian cancer drops by 40 per cent with the first child, and 55 per cent after the second; and for uterine cancer it drops by 30 per cent with the first child.

Some cancers seem to be linked to increased levels of oestrogen ? some scientists believe having periods (which stop when you are pregnant) is a cancer risk factor.

&quot;It&#39;s the pattern of hormones associated with the menstrual cycle that are to blame,&quot; says Professor Valerie Beral, Director of Cancer Research UK&#39;s epidemiology centre in Oxford.

During pregnancy and breastfeeding, oestrogen levels tend to be lower. &quot;Increased oestrogen equals increased risk of cancers.&quot;

The bad news is that motherhood puts you at greater risk of cervical cancer ? if you have lots of children. It&#39;s not clear why, but as Professor Beral explains: &quot;If a woman has eight or more children, it doubles the risk.&quot;

Weight gain

While Hollywood stars seem to drop the baby weight by simply breathing out, mortal women can struggle to lose the pounds afterwards. But there&#39;s no sound physiological reason why, say experts.

So whatever your personal theories about how it&#39;s affected your metabolism or the way your body stores fat, the fact is you&#39;re fat because you&#39;re eating too much.

Furthermore, breast-feeding mothers, who can burn an extra 500 calories a day, have even less excuse for being overweight.

&quot;A lot of women take pregnancy as an excuse to eat more than usual ? in the first few months you need only the equivalent of an extra glass of milk and piece of fruit,&quot; is the somewhat depressing news from Paul Sacher, research director of MEND, an organisation that works with obese families.

He adds that fathers are also at risk of putting on weight. &quot;Anecdotally, a lot of men are sporty till they get married. Family life is more sedentary.&quot;

When Sacher and his team try to persuade overweight families to change eating habits, it&#39;s often men who are most resistant. &quot;They want to continue with the take-aways, white bread and Coke,&quot; he explains.

Weight gain, as we&#39;re regularly told, leads to a greater risk of a host of problems, from osteoarthritis to diabetes and heart conditions.

Pregnancy puts huge stress on the body, but at least one health fear is unfounded: it does not leach calcium from the teeth.

Nigel Carter, chief executive of the British Dental Health Foundation, says: &quot;It&#39;s an old wives&#39; tale. Once calcium is in the teeth, it can&#39;t be metabolised for use elsewhere in the body.&quot;

However, that doesn&#39;t mean that having a baby is harmless for the teeth. &quot;The vast majority of us have mild gingivitis, a form of gum disease. As a result of hormone changes during pregnancy, this can become worse,&quot; says Carter.

The first sign is bleeding gums. If untreated, your teeth become loose and fall out. &quot;You used to hear mothers say: &#39;I lost the bottom set with baby number one, and the top set with number two,&#39;&quot; says Carter.

But these days, with better care ? pregnant women are entitled to free dentistry ? fewer lose their teeth.

Who among non-parents can ever comprehend the bone-crushing tiredness of the first year of a baby&#39;s life? Not only do mums and dads feel groggy, they behave that way, too.

As Dr Louise Reyner a senior lecturer in human sciences at Loughbrorough University, explains, it is the frontal cortex of the brain which is affected by sleep deprivation.

&quot;This part of the brain is responsible for language and reasoning,&quot; she says.

A sleep-deprived person will have &quot;difficulty with word-generating tasks&quot;. In other words, talking ? ever tried having a conversation with a new parent? The fact that all they can talk about is their offspring is not necessarily a sign of parental obsession, but of an inability to string together more complex thoughts.

Sleep deprivation will not only make us tired ? scientists are increasingly linking it to a depressed immune system.

So, while it may seem logical for parents who constantly catch their baby&#39;s colds to blame the playgroup their little darling attends as a hotbed of germ infestation, it could just be that their own defence against disease is damaged.
