TITLE	Hate the taste of broccoli? Take a pill

A pill has been developed to harness the cancer-fighting properties of broccoli.

Scientists hope the tablet, which is equivalent to three servings of the green vegetable, will boost the battle against colon cancer.

Human trials of the pill, which contains a key chemical found in broccoli and brussel sprouts, are set to begin in Australia this year.

It follows a study which showed two compounds found in the vegetables - indole-3-carbinol and sulforaphane - helped lower the risk of colon cancer.

The 150mg pill will contain the first chemical, 13C, which works by stimulating a detoxifying enzyme in the body.

Researchers at the University of Newcastle in New South Wales, hope separate trails with the second compound will follow.

Volunteers taking part in the three-month trial will be tested to see how the concentrate affects the level of the protective enzyme in their blood.
