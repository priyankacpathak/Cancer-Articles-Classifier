TITLE	Cervical cancer jab lasts for years

Last updated at 10:21 06 April 2006

A vaccine for cervical cancer could protect women for up to four and a half years in trials.

The cancer kills more than 1,000 women in the UK every year and the vaccine protects against the human papilloma virus which is thought to be the main cause.

Up to half of the young women in the UK are thought to have been infected with a high-risk strain of HPV by the time they are 30.

However, use of the drug is set to spark controversy. The vaccine is likely to be administered to girls as young as 10-years-old.

Because HPV is transmitted through sexual intercourse, some critics have argued that treating young girls with the vaccine might encourage under-age sex.

The research, published by The Lancet online, studied the effect of the vaccine on two strains of the virus, HPV-16 and HPV-18.

The US researchers took smear test samples from 800 women who took part in a trial of the vaccine. The women had either received three doses of the vaccine or a dummy pill.

The researchers found that women given the vaccine had high levels of antibodies against the virus strains, four and a half years after receiving the last dose.

Dr Harper said the study showed the vaccine to be safe in the long term and it provided "substantial" long-term protection against cancerous cell changes associated with HPV.

She added: "These findings set the stage for the widescale adoption of HPV vaccination for prevention of cervical cancer."
