TITLE	Should I come off HRT?

The reason your doctor has suggested you should stop your HRT now is because after 5 years use (in women over 50) there is an increased risk of getting breast cancer. Overall, though, this risk is very small - about two extra cases for every 100 women on HRT compared to 1,000 women not taking HRT.

Recent research in America has also suggested that HRT may increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, though this research was done on older women (average age 63) and was only done with 1 type of HRT, similar to the no-bleed brand Premique.

We simply don't know if the same risks apply to slightly younger women, or those taking different types of HRT. But, and it's a big but, HRT can help prevent cancer of the bowel, and also there's increasing evidence that it can help keep your brain functioning well, and help prevent Alzheimers, and this is clearly important for you.

What you have to do is weigh up your own health status. If you have no family history of breast cancer, and you are otherwise fit and healthy and therefore not at increased risk of heart disease for another reason, then overall it may be best for you to carry on with HRT. But if someone in your family has had breast cancer, or you have diabetes, or are a smoker, or are very overweight (which can all increase your risk of heart disease) then it may be best for you to stop HRT now.

But that doesn't mean you are off it for good. If you start feeling tired again, or your brain starts feeling muzzy, then you can always start taking it again.
