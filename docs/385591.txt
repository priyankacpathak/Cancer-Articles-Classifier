TITLE	Long term HRT 'increases breast cancer risk'

Last updated at 16:39 10 May 2006

Women using oestrogen-only HRT for more than 10 years may have an increased risk of breast cancer, researchers said.

The news is likely to increase fears among menopausal women. In a recent survey three-quarters of women said they would not recommend HRT to their daughters because of suggested links with cancer.

Oestrogen-only HRT is reserved for women who have had hysterectomies as it increases the risk of womb cancer. The US study found the longer a woman had been using oestrogen, the higher her risk of breast cancer. Those who had been taking oestrogen for more than 20 years had a significantly increased risk.

However, taking the HRT for less than 10 years did not present a significant breast cancer risk.

Alternatives

Liz Carroll, from Breast Cancer Care, said: "Women who are taking HRT for longer than 10 years should be aware of the potential risks and discuss possible alternatives with their doctor."

The study followed 29,000 women between 1976 and 2002. They found 934 invasive breast cancers developed, 226 among women who had never used HRT and 708 who had taken oestrogen.

Research leader Dr Wendy Chen wrote: "We found that oestrogen therapy was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer with longer-term use."
