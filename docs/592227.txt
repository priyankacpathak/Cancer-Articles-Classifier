TITLE	Heatwave brings skin cancer warning

&bull;Are we protecting ourselves? &bull;Calculate your sun factor

A major new alert over skin cancer was issued today as experts claimed the current high temperatures have increased the danger in London.

The Met Office issued an official warning over record levels of harmful UV rays.

The rise in levels has been caused by a lack of pollution and cloud, both of which normally filter out UV rays.

Pollution levels have dropped significantly because the current hot weather is caused by air from the deep tropics, where there is little pollution.

Usually Britain&#39;s air comes from the continent, where pollutant levels are far higher. Temperatures could reach 30C today and last week hit 32C.

Experts are warning Londoners that they should wear a hat and sunglasses every time they venture out for more than 10 minutes.

Wayne Elliot of the Met Office said: &#39;We are getting record UV levels at the moment because there is not a great deal of pollution around.

&#39;Normally our air is brought up through Europe, and has a lot of pollutants in it. But currently the warm spell is coming from the deep tropics and it is unusually clear. This means far more UV gets through the atmosphere than normal.

&#39;We would urge people to ensure they are protected, even if they are just walking to work in the morning.&#39;

Cancer experts have also called for people to apply sunscreen far more regularly. Zoe Norridge of Cancer Research UK said: &#39;When UV levels are this high you can burn in under 10 minutes. Even if you are walking to work or sitting in the park at lunchtime, you should keep in the shade and wear a hat and sunglasses.

&#39;Children should always wear a hat, and if you&#39;re out having lunch, sit under a tree.&#39;

UV levels are measured in an index of one to 10, with 10 being the most dangerous. Levels are expected to rocket today and tomorrow, when the UV index is expected to rise to seven, classified as &#39;very high risk&#39;. Experts say that normal levels for June would be about five.

A recent study by Cancer Research UK found that 35 per cent of people never use sunscreen. However, an Evening Standard survey revealed that half of the Londoners we found sunbathing did not use sunscreen.

Men are believed to be at particular risk. Dr Ian Banks, president of the Men&#39;s Health Forum, said that although more women than men get the deadly melanoma form of skin cancer, more men die from it because they do not seek help quickly enough.

Dr Banks, who is also a GP, said: &#39;Men go to see a doctor later rather than sooner and many men are dying unnecessarily because of that.

&#39;Men get burnt more often because they don&#39;t wear sun cream. They also get sunburnt through their shirts when they are at football matches because the replica shirts are so thin.&#39;
