TITLE	HRT trial halted over cancer fears

Doctors have halted another major HRT study after early findings showed women were being made to face an "unacceptably high risk" of breast cancer.

The Swedish trial was set up to assess the effect of hormone replacement therapy on women with a previous history of the disease.

It was stopped three years early when the results showed that HRT significantly increased the chances of recurring breast cancer or the appearance of a new tumour.

The study, known as Habits (hormonal replacement therapy after breast cancer diagnosis - is it safe?), was originally meant to include at least 1,300 women monitored for five years.

Doctors halted it on December 17 last year after an average follow-up of just two years.

Of 174 women assigned to hormone replacement therapy, 26 reported a recurrence or new case of breast cancer.

In contrast, only seven women who received therapy other than HRT for menopausal symptoms re-encountered the disease.

All the women taking part in the trial had been successfully treated for breast cancer in the past.

Most were given HRT consisting of a combination of oestrogen and progestagen hormones. Women whose wombs had been removed were recommended a medium-strength oestrogen-only treatment.

Chief investigator Lars Holmberg, from University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden, said: "The Habits trial was terminated because women with a history of breast cancer allocated to receive HRT for menopausal symptoms experienced an unacceptably high risk of breast cancer compared with breast cancer survivors allocated to best symptomatic treatment without hormones. Women on active treatment have been advised to discontinue."
