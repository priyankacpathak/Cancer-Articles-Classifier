TITLE	A 'breakthrough' breast cancer scan

Last updated at 11:02 17 May 2005

Hi-tech MRI scans could dramatically improve the detection of breast cancer in thousands of women most at risk, research has shown.

The scans are twice as effective as X-ray mammograms at spotting tumours in younger women with a strong family history of the disease.

But there would be major problems in making the potentially life-saving scans widely available.

Throughout the UK there are already long waits for MRI appointments, with one in five patients waiting more than a year.

NHS guidance on the screening of high-risk women would have to be reviewed and finance could be an issue, with MRI scans costing ten times as much as standard mammograms.

Huge savings

There could be huge savings on treatment, however, from catching cases early.

Each year 41,000 women in the UK are diagnosed with breast cancer. Some 8,000 cases occur in pre-menopausal women. Between 1,000 and 2,000 are due to faulty genes called BRCA1 and BRCA2.

Women with these genes can have mammograms from the age of 30 - 20 years before other women become eligible for regular screening.

But mammograms are not as effective in younger women as their breast tissue tends to be denser, making it harder to detect tumours.

Defective genes

Because of this, in some clinics 40 per cent of women with the defective genes opt for preventative mastectomy.

Now a study published in The Lancet medical journal has found that Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans dramatically improve the effectiveness of screening.

Research by the Institute of Cancer Research in London found that X-rays picked up 40 per cent of tumours, MRI detected 77 per cent and when both were used together, an impressive 94 per cent were found.
