TITLE	The facts about sun exposure

Over 1,000 men are dying from skin cancer each year because they are ignoring warnings to stay out of the sun, new research has found.

Here we look at the dangers of sun exposure:

Experts believe that on the hottest days of the summer normal skin can burn in 20 minutes and claim brief, intense exposure to the sun raises the risk of developing cancer.

Health officials advise that both adults and youngsters avoid the sun in the middle of the day between 11am and 3pm, cover up with a hat, T-shirt and sunglasses and use sunscreen of factor 15 or higher.

Over 65,400 cases of skin cancer are diagnosed each year in the UK making it the most common type of cancer. Around 7,000 cases are malignant melanoma - the most serious form of the disease. This has doubled over the last 10 years and kills 1,600 people each year.

People are often at more risk of burning when swimming, in a cool breeze, outdoors in the shade, in the mountains and on cloudy or overcast days.

People with fair skin that tends to burn or freckle are at higher risk of skin cancer.

Children are most at risk from exposure to the sun as their thin and delicate skin offers less protection against sun damage. Yet a survey of more than 200 parents found 41 per cent thought a tanned child looked healthier.

Experts believe that sunburn in children can double their risk of getting skin cancer later in life. Young infants should not be left out in the sun at all. They should be exposed to direct sunlight only in a handful of brief periods outdoors each week.
