A stormy marriage might not be good for the peace of mind, but it could have its benefits for health. 

A study of breast cancer patients found that those in tumultuous relationships had smaller, more easily treated tumours. 

The finding contradicts the theory that stress feeds the growth of breast cancer. 

The researchers said: 'We found no evidence that stress increased the risk of having a large breast cancer and intimate relationship stress appeared to reduce it. 

'Our study suggests there is no reason to fear that it will result in a more advanced breast cancer at diagnosis.' 

The Australian researchers, from Sydney University, asked 1,500 breast cancer patients about the amount of stress they had been under in the year before diagnosis. 

Potential sources of stress included separation, divorce or the break-up of a relationship. 

The women who were in a stressful relationship and lived with their partner at the time of the diagnosis were 36 per cent less likely to have a tumour greater than two centimetres. 

Writing in the journal Cancer Causes Control, the researchers said it is likely that stress cuts production of oestrogen, the hormone which fuels the growth of many breast tumours.
