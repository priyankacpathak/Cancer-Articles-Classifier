TITLE	Aspirin in new cancer hope

Taking a regular dose of aspirin could halve the risk of developing cancer of the gullet, say experts.

US scientists say other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may cut the chances of developing the disease by a quarter.

Their report is published in the medical journal Gastroenterology.

Cancer of the oesophagus affects 7,000 Britons each year. Aspirin is already taken daily by more than two million Britons to ward off heart attacks and strokes.

Previous studies have suggested that aspirin may reduce the risk of bowel, lung and pancreatic cancer.
