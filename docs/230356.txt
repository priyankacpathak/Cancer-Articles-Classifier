TITLE	Housework 'cuts cancer risk'

Last updated at 16:08 30 March 2004

Daily household chores could help protect women against cancer, scientists have found.

Gentle, regular exercise is thought to be a powerful weapon against both breast and womb cancer.

Even tasks such as cleaning the house or hanging up washing can have an effect.

Starting exercise in your teens and continuing into adulthood appears to offer the best protection.

The findings of two studies which highlight the protective effect of regular exercise were published yesterday at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research.

Scientists do not know exactly why exercise protects against the disease. It is thought it may help equip the body to destroy "rogue" cancer cells before they form tumours.

Experts from Vanderbilt Medical Centre in Nashville and the Shanghai Cancer Institute in China studied 832 women aged between 30 and 69 to judge the effect of exercise on womb cancer.

Those who took part in sport as teenagers and adults were up to 40 per cent less likely to develop the disease.

Simple activities such as household chores and a daily walk had a similar effect, cutting the risk by 30 per cent.

Women who walked for an hour a day benefited more than those heading out for just half an hour.
