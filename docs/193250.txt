TITLE	Pesticides link to cancer

Farmers are already under a lot of pressure - foot and mouth, falling prices and EU targets to name a few.

Now scientists say that working with pesticides may increase a man's risk of prostate cancer.

New research has found people routinely in contact with pesticides, such as farmers, had a 13 per cent higher chance of developing the disease than those who were not exposed to the chemicals.

Dr Genevieve Van Maele-Fabry and colleagues from Ghent University in Belgium said it was difficult to separate the effects of pesticides from those of genetic, lifestyle or other factors.

Firm conclusions about whether or not pesticides can cause prostate cancer could not be drawn.

Nevertheless, a "significant increase in rate ratio" was observed for pesticide applicators.

This group included farm workers, crop sprayers, greenhouse workers and park keepers.

The scientists said the trend could have important public health implications across whole populations.

They said the findings, published in the journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine, echoed those of similar previous studies.

The researchers wrote: "Although the underlying data do not identify pesticide exposure as an independent cause for prostate cancer, the fact that an increased meta-ratio is again obtained points to occupational exposure to pesticides as a possible factor."

In Britain, the Health Protection Agency is conducting a five year investigation into the health effects of pesticides and other chemicals.
