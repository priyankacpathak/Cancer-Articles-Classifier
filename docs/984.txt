TITLE	Hormone treat in U.S. Beef

by SEAN POULTER, Daily Mail

British tourists heading to the U.S. are being warned that American burgers and steaks could contain a cancer-causing growth hormone. Children may be particularly at risk. The findings are the result of a study by EU scientists.

'We can't tell people who travel to America whether or not they should eat beef,' said a spokesman. 'But we should give consumers all the possible information, so they can make an informed choice. It is our duty to let people know what they are eating.'

Privately, however, some officials say they will avoid American beef. 'If I have the choice I won't eat it,' said one who has read the findings.

The study concluded that one of six growth hormones routinely fed to American cattle, and banned in Europe, can carry a cancer risk. Not enough was known about the other five to be sure they were safe either.

A summary of the report concluded: 'As concerns excess intake of hormone residues - a risk to the consumer has been identified with different levels of conclusive evidence for the six hormones in question.' It said one - 17 beta oestradiol - 'has to be considered as a complete carcinogen, as it exerts both tumour-initiating and tumour-promoting effects.' The document goes on to say: 'For the other five hormones - the current state of knowledge does not allow a quantitative estimate of the risk.'

As with any harmful substance, the report points out that children would be particularly vulnerable to any high level of the hormones involved.
