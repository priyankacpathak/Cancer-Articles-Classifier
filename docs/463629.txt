TITLE	Fish oil can help beat a killer in the genes

Last updated at 00:54 22 June 2007

Further evidence that a diet rich in oily fish could cut the risk of death from prostate cancer has emerged.

Dietary changes may be particularly beneficial for those with a family history of the disease, the latest findings suggest.

Researchers have shown that omega 3 - a fatty acid abundant in fish such as mackerel, sardines and salmon - improves survival by slowing the growth of the deadly tumours.

As the cancer usually develops in over-50s, it is possible that if men genetically prone to the cancer boosted their intake of the nutrient early in life, tumour development could be stopped or delayed long enough to allow them to live out their natural lifespan.

Prostate is the most common form of cancer contracted by British men, with nearly 32,000 new cases each year.

The study looked at the effect of omega 3 on mice genetically engineered to develop prostate cancer. Fed a diet rich in the fat, 60 per cent died of the cancer. When levels of the fat were low, all the mice died.

The findings, by researchers at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine in North Carolina, are published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.
