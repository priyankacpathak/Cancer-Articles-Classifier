TITLE	Onions fight prostate cancer

by ROGER DOBSON, Daily Mail

Onions and leeks offer the best protection against prostate cancer, while eating meat is the biggest risk factor for the disease, according to new research.

Scientists, who had studied the diets and environments of 32 countries and compared them with national prostate cancer rates, have been able to identify what protects and what increases the risk.

The results show that animal products are the risk factors for prostate cancer, and that vegetables are risk reducers.

Prostate cancer mortality rates vary significantly across the world. The rates in the UK and northern Europe, as well as America, are around five times higher than in Hong Kong, Iran, Japan and Turkey.

Prostate cancer is almost unheard of in areas of Greenland, where fish is the main food, and is very low in areas of China where green tea is the main drink.

The research shows that the strongest risk factor for prostate cancer mortality was animal products, including meat and dairy products, while the most beneficial were onions, garlic and leeks, followed by cereals, grains, beans, fruits and vegetables. Alcohol was found to be a minor risk.

The researchers also looked at sunlight levels in each of the countries, and found that vitamin D offered some protection.

It is thought that the vitamin plays a role in slowing down the progression of the disease by binding to cancer cells and either killing them or making the cells more benign and less malignant.

No independent effect was found for tomatoes, a source of lycopene, thought to reduce the risk of prostate cancer.
