TITLE	HRT 'could double the threat of skin cancer'

Women who undergo hormone replacement therapy for the menopause could be dramatically increasing their risk of skin cancer. 

Those on HRT for more than six months at a time are twice as likely to develop a malignant melanoma, researchers discovered. 

They also found taking the Pill for more than six months makes it 28 per cent more likely that a cancerous mole will develop. 

The study, published in the journal Annals of Oncology, compared nearly 800 Dutch women diagnosed with a melanoma between 1991 and 2004 with a group of 4,000 cancer-free women. 

It is thought the higher risk may be due to the way oestrogen in the HRT stimulates the growth of skin cells, called melanocytes. 

The study, by experts at Leiden University in the Netherlands, is the latest to highlight the health risks associated with taking HRT. 

It is already linked with breast cancer and an increased risk of potentially fatal blood clots. 

Malignant melanomas kill around 1,700 people a year in the UK.

Over-exposure to the sun's rays is the major cause and since the mid-1990s there has been a 24 per cent increase in cases. 

Dr Joanna Owens, from Cancer Research UK, said UV radiation was still the biggest danger.

She said: 'Without knowing how much sun exposure these women had, this study tells us nothing new.'
