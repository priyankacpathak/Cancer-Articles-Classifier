TITLE	Pesticide cancer risk to babies

Last updated at 09:42 21 March 2006

Babies and young children may be at risk of developing cancer through exposure to pesticides on food.

Low levels of chemicals found in pesticides and plastics are more influential in causing cancer than previously thought, scientists have warned.

They claim these chemicals pass to humans from eating meat and dairy products and can also be transferred from a mother to her baby via breast milk.

Cancer experts are calling for a reduction in human exposure to chemicals such as pesticides in light of the findings.

Jamie Page, Chairman of the Cancer Prevention and Education Society, said: "It is our opinion that far more attention and effort must be made to reduce human exposure to harmful chemicals."

Professor Vyvyan Howard and John Newby, from Liverpool University claim their research contradicts past studies which concluded that the levels of these chemicals were too low to be considered a factor in cancer.

The research has found that exposure even to small amounts of these chemicals may result in an increased risk of developing cancer - particularly for infants and young adults.

Professor Howard said synthetic pesticides could also be a major factor in causing breast, testicular and prostate cancers.

He added: "We should be focusing on trying to reduce exposure to problematic chemicals."

The research is published in the Taylor  and  Francis Journal of Nutritional and Environmental Medicine.
