Breakfast is undoubtedly the most important meal of the day energy-wise. What's more, experts say that a healthy breakfast can help reduce your risk of cancer.

Since a third of all cancers are diet-related, starting the day with a healthy meal means you get a whoosh of good nutrients plus you're less likely to succumb to unhealthy (and fattening) snacks before lunch.

My current favourite is soda bread drizzled with olive oil, with smoked salmon and horseradish cream, plus an apple.

To raise funds for research, Cancer Research UK is urging everyone to hold a breakfast party.
