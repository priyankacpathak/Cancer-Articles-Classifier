TITLE	Irish pork cancer scare forces British supermarkets to pull meat from shelves

Supermarkets across England, Scotland and Wales have withdrawn Irish pork  from sale after cancer-causing dioxins were found in pork products in Ireland.

The warning was flashed  to the UK after it was confirmed the poisons had been found in bacon and ham produced in the Irish Republic.

All Irish pork products were recalled from stores in Ireland last night and shelves were cleared after the discovery of the toxins in slaughtered pigs.

The Food Standards Agency has advised consumers not to eat pork or pork products, such as sausages, bacon, salami and ham, which are labeled as being from the Irish Republic or Northern Ireland.

It said it was making the precautionary recommendation while it continued to investigate whether any contaminated pork products had entered the UK market. 

Animal feed contaminated with dioxins was understood to have infected Irish pig products, including foods sold across Ireland and exported to the UK. 

A group of products from some Irish farms were found to contain between 80 and 200 times the recommended safe levels of dioxins, chemicals that cause a variety of cancers. 

The contaminated feed was used at a total of 37 Irish farms, of which 29 were pork farms and eight were beef. 

Britain&#8217;s Food Standards Agency said if dioxins were found in any pork products imported from Ireland, supermarkets would be ordered to clear their shelves of any sliced, cooked or raw pig meat. 

An FSA spokesman said: &#8216;The investigation in Ireland is ongoing and we are waiting to hear if there are any infected products coming into the UK. 

'If this is the case, we will take action and companies will remove the products from the market. We do not believe there will be a significant risk to UK consumers.&#8217; 

Latest official figures show that between April and July, the UK imported 15,000 tons of pork and bacon from Ireland, out of a total of 230,000 tons of imports. 

The news was last night described as the &#8216;foot-and-mouth crisis of Irish farming&#8217;. The pig industry is Ireland&#8217;s fourth-largest agricultural business, with  £374million worth of pork products sold every year. The Irish recall affected all goods produced since September 1. 

Last night, the Irish Government was under pressure to explain why it had taken more than three months for testing to show up the extent of the dioxin levels. 

'It was also facing questions about why it delayed making an announcement as the contamination was first noticed last Monday but was only confirmed yesterday. 

Consumers and retailers were warned to destroy all Irish pork and bacon products bought since September 1. It is feared the recall could cripple the country&#8217;s 400 pig farmers in the  run-up to Christmas. 

A spokesman for Tesco, Britain&#8217;s biggest supermarket chain, said: &#8216;We believe we may be hardly affected because we take barely anything from the Republic.&#8217; 

A Sainsbury&#8217;s spokeswoman said: &#8216;We don&#8217;t get any pork or bacon from the Republic of Ireland. It&#8217;s British, Dutch or Danish.&#8217; And a Waitrose spokeswoman said: &#8216;All our pork is from East Anglia or Southern England.&#8217; 

Professor Alan Boobis, head of the Department of Health Toxicology Unit at Imperial College London, said studies suggested that dioxins do not have the same impact on human genes as they do on animals. &#8216;Exposure at an elevated level over a month or so would not do any damage.&#8217;
