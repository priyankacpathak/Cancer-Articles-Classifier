TITLE	Cancer survivors put health at risk 'by failing to exercise'

Cancer survivors could be putting their health at risk by not being active enough, research suggested today.

A study found that breast cancer survivors were among those likely to be overweight, which could make their prognosis worse. 

Obesity and taking little exercise is generally linked to poor disease outcomes, the authors said. In cancer patients, studies have have linked inactivity and being fat with recurrence of the disease, death and a reduced quality of life. 

More than 114,000 people were questioned for the study, published in the journal Cancer, and asked if they had participated in any activities from a list in the past three months.

The activities included walking, jogging, skiing and weight-training, and people were also asked to name activities not listed. They were also asked how often they took part in the activity and how long each session lasted.

The authors found that around one in five of survivors were physically active at the ideal level, with the lowest activity rates among female bowel cancer survivors (14 per cent) and breast cancer survivors (17 per cent).

Obese breast cancer survivors were less likely to be active than obese women without a history of cancer. 

The Canadian authors, from the University of Alberta, said the finding was consistent with a previous study "that showed that obese women reported a disproportionate decline in physical activity levels after a breast cancer diagnosis compared with non-obese women.

"This finding is cause for concern because physical activity may be particularly important for obese breast cancer survivors. 

"Obesity itself is strongly associated with poorer disease outcomes and obese breast cancer survivors may particularly benefit from higher physical activity levels in terms of disease outcomes. 

"In summary... cancer survivors have low levels of physical activity and high levels of obesity that may place them at higher risk for poorer disease control and supportive care outcomes." 

Sara Hiom, Cancer Research UK's director of health information, said: "Being diagnosed with cancer is always a great shock and cancer patients may feel emotionally as well as physically weak while they recover from treatment.

"Many will worry about the risk of their cancer coming back so it is a good idea for them to ask their GP or consultant for advice on planning and maintaining as healthy a lifestyle as is practical according to individual circumstances."
