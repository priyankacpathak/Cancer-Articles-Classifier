TITLE	'Aspirin ups risk of cancer' - survey

Women who take aspirin regularly for 20 years have an increased chance of developing pancreatic cancer, according to a survey of 90,000 females.

Scientists studied thousands of American women, finding that those who took two or more tablets each week for two decades had a 58% increased chance of developing the disease.

The risk of developing pancreatic cancer increased as the dose got bigger  up to 86% higher for those who took the drug twice a day.

Aspirin has been hailed as a wonder drug and is commonly recommended as a preventative treatment for heart disease.

It has also been suggested as a preventative drug against Alzheimer's disease and can prevent deep vein thrombosis during long haul flights.

The researchers, based at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston, warned in their study that doctors and patients must balance the benefits of aspirin with the risks suggested by the new study.

The scientists studied nearly 90,000 women.

Among them, 34% were defined as regular users, taking two or more 325mg aspirin tablets per week.

The regular users, over the next two decades, were found to be 58% more likely to develop cancer of the pancreas.

Those who took two tablets a day for 20 years were 86% more likely to get the cancer, said the report, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.
