TITLE	Cancer is linked to strip lighting

by SUZANNE STEVENSON, Metro

Millions of women were yesterday given their starkest warning yet that they risked developing breast cancer by working under strip lighting.

Shiftworkers are those in greatest danger

Danger: shiftworkers under strip lights face the greatest risk

as they are exposed to artificial light at night-time, the first major British study into the problem found.

Strip lights reduce levels of the hormone melatonin, which controls the body clock and is linked to cancer.

The warning arises from official research which confirms the findings of four previous studies.

Epidemiologist Prof Anthony Swerdlow, who carried out the latest study, said there was an ' appreciable' link between shift work and breast cancer, which kills 13,000 women each year.

The professor, from the Institute of Cancer Research, was commissioned by the Health and Safety Executive.

He said: 'You have to ask two questions. Firstly, if more women who work shifts get breast cancer and, if that is the case, is it because of the shift work or something else, such as different exercise patterns?

'There is no doubt that exposure to artificial light decreases the level of melatonin.'

The hormone is produced by a gland in the brain, principally between the hours of 9pm and 8am.

Lower levels of melatonin can lead to increased levels of oestrogen, a suspected breast cancer trigger.

There are five times fewer cases of the disease in developing countries, where electric light is less widespread, than in industrialised nations.

Claims that shift work - carried out by 2million women in Britain - could lead to breast cancer first emerged in 1987, although subsequent studies have failed to establish a definitive link.
