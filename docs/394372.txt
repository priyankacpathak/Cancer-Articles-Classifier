TITLE	Paracetamol 'may cut ovarian cancer risk'

Last updated at 15:31 06 July 2006

Taking regular doses of paracetamol could cut the risk of ovarian cancer by a third.

A study of more than 4,000 women found that taking around a tablet a day could help prevent the cancer developing.

But the team of scientists from Athens who led the research warned taking the painkiller long-term could damage the liver and kidneys outweighing any benefits.

The link between paracetamol and ovarian cancer has been made before. The latest findings, published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, analysed the results of eight previous studies.

Ovarian cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women, with around 6,900 new cases in the UK every year, according to the charity Ovacome. The disease kills around 4,600 women in the UK every year.

Because it has few initial symptoms, the cancer is often not diagnosed until it has spread to other parts of the body.

The team reviewed studies involving paracetamol and ovarian cancer between 1966 to 2004 in the UK, US and Denmark. The scientists concluded more research needed to be done to prove the health benefits of paracetamol.

But Dr Kat Arney, science information officer at Cancer Research UK, said all new findings into fighting the disease were welcome: 'This is a large and potentially important analysis that uses results from many different studies. Ovarian cancer kills around 4,600 women in the UK every year, and anything that can reduce this toll is welcome.

'But taking large doses of paracetamol over a long period of time can also have side effects. The next step is to do laboratory research to understand more about how paracetamol achieves this protective effect and to test the benefits of the drug in a large-scale clinical trial.'
