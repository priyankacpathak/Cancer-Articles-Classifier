TITLE	Carrot-a-day reduces cancer risk

Last updated at 11:28 09 February 2005

A carrot a day helps keep cancer away, scientists revealed today.

A compound in the popular root vegetable has been found to reduce the risk of developing the killer disease.

Now scientists at Newcastle University say that eating a small carrot every day can help prevent the development of cancer.

A team of researchers found the natural pesticide falcarinol decreased the likelihood of rats developing cancer by one third.

Although experts have recommended that people eat carrots for their anti-cancer properties, it has not been known exactly what component of the vegetable has this effect.

The study, published today in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, is significant because it could lead to the development of anti-cancer drugs.

The scientists, from Newcastle University and Denmark, investigated the falcarinol, which protects carrots from fungal diseases, after a previous published study suggested it could prevent the development of cancer.

The experiment was conducted using raw carrots so researchers do not yet know if eating boiled carrots or drinking carrot juice, for example, would have the same effect.

Researcher Dr Kirsten Brandt, who says she eats "more carrots than most" and grows her own organic varieties, recommends that consumers should eat one small carrot every day, together with other vegetables and fruits, to benefit from their health-giving properties.

Falcarinol is toxic in large amounts but to obtain a lethal dose you would have to eat 882lb (400kg) of carrots at once.

Researchers suspect it is effective because it stimulates mechanisms in the body that fight cancer, although they have yet to carry out a detailed analysis in this respect.
