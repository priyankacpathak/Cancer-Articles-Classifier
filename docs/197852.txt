TITLE	Sunscreen defence after cancer alert

Sunscreen manufacturers insisted their products offer good protection despite new research which suggests they may not prevent skin cancer.

Scientists from a medical research charity found that ultraviolet A (UVA) light still penetrates the skin even when sunscreen lotions are used in the recommended dosage.

UVA light causes the release of free radicals, which damages DNA and can in turn lead to malignant melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer.

Researchers at the Restoration of Appearance and Function Trust (RAFT), based at Mount Vernon Hospital in north west London, concluded that using sunscreen could actually increase the risk of developing melanoma because people tend to stay out in the sun for longer without burning.

But high street chemist Boots, which produces its own range of sunscreen lotions, said using a good sunscreen was still the best way to stay safe in the sun.

A Boots spokeswoman said: "Being safe in the sun is still the most important thing for people to remember, because we know that staying out of the sunshine completely is not an option most people care for.

"You shouldn't assume that just because you're wearing sunscreen you're completely protected. However, wearing sunscreen and being sensible in the sun is far better than the alternatives, and we think it's unrealistic to ask people to stay out of the sun.

"At the moment, using a good sunscreen and being sensible is still the best way to stay safe in the sun."

She added that Boots continually improves and refines its suncare products and has already planned to introduce higher UVA protection next year.

Professor Roy Sanders, who led the research at RAFT, said sunscreen lotions currently did not offer adequate UVA protection.
