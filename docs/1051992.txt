TITLE	Height 'raises risk of prostate cancer' by 20 per cent a foot

Being tall raises the odds of prostate cancer, research shows. 

A study of thousands of men showed that every four inches on their height increased their chances of developing the disease by around 6 per cent. 

This means a man of 6ft 4in is almost 20 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer than a friend a foot shorter. 

The reason is not clear, but the Bristol University researchers said hormones which influence height may also be involved in the cancer. Previous studies have shown that weight can play a part. 

They urged tall men not to worry, saying factors such as age and genetics are much more influential. 

Dr Luisa Zuccolo said: 'The insight arising from this research is of great scientific interest. Little is known of the causes of prostate cancer and this association with height has opened up a new line of scientific inquiry.'
