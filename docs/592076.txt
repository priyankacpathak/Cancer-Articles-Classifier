TITLE	Cancer fear over children's sun creams

Last updated at 09:14 23 June 2004

Thousands of youngsters are at risk of developing skin cancer because sun creams are failing to keep out harmful rays.

Seven in eight creams designed for children and babies did not offer the protection claimed on the bottle, according to research.

The survey was commissioned by the Trading Standards Institute, which is demanding the Government imposes tough regulation of the sun cream industry.

Britain already has around 2,000 deaths a year from skin cancer, twice the number in Australia, where there has been a 20-year campaign of sun awareness.

The Trading Standards Institute said three of the eight sun creams tested at independent laboratories failed to offer the protection against UVA rays claimed on the bottles.

Doctors are particularly concerned about UVA rays because they penetrate beneath the skin and are linked to long-term DNA cell damage and skin cancer.

Four of the eight did not offer the claimed protection against UVB radiation, which burns the outer skin and is known as a trigger for cancer.

The institute&#39;s chief executive, Ron Gainsford, said: &#39;It is a major concern to us that parents could be unwittingly exposing their children to the risk of sun damage, thinking they are better protected than they actually are.

&#39;Nobody puts sun cream on themselves or their children because it makes them look better - they do it solely for health reasons and this should be reflected in its testing regime and in the legislation governing it.

&#39;It seems crazy that in the UK and Europe sun creams are afforded the same regulatory status as lipsticks. In the U.S. and Australia the industry is much more strictly controlled.&#39;

The UVA protection level is defined on packs as a star rating. The rating runs from one to five stars, depending on the level of protection.

The protection against UVB is defined as the SPF or Sun Protection Factor, which ranges up to 50-plus. In theory an SPF rating of 15 should mean it is possible to stay in the sun 15 times longer without burning.

The institute has refused to identify the failing brands involved in the survey, however it is thought to be dominated by smaller manufacturers, rather than big names such as Ambre Solaire, Nivea and Piz Buin.

Boots said its Soltan product for children was the only one of the eight creams tested that gave the promised protection against both UVA and UVB rays.

The Trading Standards Institute&#39;s spokesman on sun safety, Judith Johnson, said: &#39;Last year the UK had more deaths from skin cancer than Australia. The incidence of new skin cancer cases is rising here at an alarming rate.

&#39;These tests show that a number of the products that parents are buying to protect their children are not meeting the claims made for them.&#39;

She added: &#39;We are increasingly seeing sunscreen manufacturers focus on higher and higher levels of UVB protection, leading consumers to believe they can stay in the sun longer and so increasing their exposure to the most harmful UVA rays.

&#39;The Government and Europe must step in now.&#39; Sun creams have to comply with cosmetics safety laws which also cover general beauty products.

However, these regulations do not include a method for determining SPF or UVA protection values and do not give guidance about what claims can or cannot be included in labelling.

The Trading Standards Institute is calling for: &bull;Standard tests on a sun cream&#39;s SPF, UVA and water resistance - currently manufacturers choose their own testing methods. &bull;Only approved laboratories to carry out testing. &bull;Regulations on how a product can be described, including a restriction on statements alleging that it offers &#39;complete protection&#39; or &#39;sun block&#39;. &bull;An upper limit on a product&#39;s SPF of 30. The extra protection offered above 30 is minimal. &bull;A mandatory &#39;best before&#39; date on all products sold solely for sun protection. &bull;Clear instructions on bottles and packaging for product use and storage. &bull;The Government to fund a campaign to teach children about the risks of exposure and to help them understand sun protection terminology.
