TITLE	Obesity linked to breast cancer

by TIM UTTON, Daily Mail

Women who are obese are 20 per cent more likely to develop breast cancer later in life, British scientists have warned. They have also pinpointed why this is so.

Obesity increases the body's levels of oestrogen - a sex hormone strongly linked to breast cancer - and a type of oestrogen called oestradiol was found to be particularly associated with higher risk.

About 40,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year. Britain has one of the world's highest rates of the disease, with about 13,000 deaths from it every year.

Dr Tim Key, of the Cancer Research UK Epidemiology Unit, headed the team at Oxford University, working on a joint project with scientists in Italy, Japan and the U.S.

He said: 'Women's risk is affected by many fixed factors: family history of the disease; the number of children they have; the age they have children; when they start their periodsand when they stop. But obesity is something that women have a level of control over. Maintaining a healthy weight avoids extra risk.'

The study looked at eight separate investigations around the world and compared Body Mass Index and sex hormone levels in 2,300 women.

BMI expresses a person's weight relative to their height. All the women were cancer-free and not using hormone replacement therapy when the blood was taken.

But 624 went on to develop breast cancer and 1,669 did not. The scientists found that as BMI climbed so did oestrogen levels. The breast cancer risk was 18 per cent higher for obese women.

Dr Lesley Walker, of Cancer Research UK, said: 'By maintaining a healthy weight through exercise and a balanced diet, women can avoid extra breast cancer risk.'
