TITLE	Garlic and onions 'cut prostate danger'

A diet high in garlic, onions and leeks can halve the risk of prostate cancer, research suggests.

The vegetables are rich in compounds called alliums, which are active against substances produced naturally in the body and linked to ageing and the development of cancer.

Scientists say men should eat ten grams of garlic, onion, leek, spring onion or shallot each day to get the best protection.

Dr Ann Hsing, of America's National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, who led the research, said ten grams of garlic was about two and a half cloves, and ideally it should be eaten raw.

'Clearly, that's not very practical for most people, so I would suggest a clove of lightly cooked garlic and then good servings of the other allium vegetables,' she said.

The study is published today in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

Lycopene, found in tomatoes, also appears to reduce the risk of prostate cancer.
