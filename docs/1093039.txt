TITLE	After alert over Irish pork, how safe is beef?

The health alert over Irish pork spread to beef yesterday. 

Tests found illegal levels of cancer risk chemicals in meat from three farms in the Republic. 

The discovery of the dioxins is a major blow for the Irish beef industry, which exports meat worth tens of millions each year. 

The Dublin Government said it will not impose any kind of ban because the dioxin levels do not pose a safety hazard - they were only two to three times the permitted limit compared to the 80 to 200 times in pork. 

But other countries may introduce their own bans and consumers could boycott the beef. 

The results of similar tests on eight farms in Northern Ireland will be known later this week. 

The contamination has been traced to feed distributed in Ireland since September. 

Britain's Food Standards Agency warned consumers against eating any pork from Ireland when the problem first emerged. 

Subsequently, Tesco announced it would still sell Irish pork products because it was confident they came from farms that did not use the suspect feed. 

The FSA then said it would let supermarkets sell Irish pork if they could satisfy themselves it did not come from suspect farms. 

The bizarre result is that Tesco is selling Irish pork products to British customers, despite the fact that on local advice they are banned in Ireland.
