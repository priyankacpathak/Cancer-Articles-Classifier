TITLE	Could a fry-up help you fight cancer?

Last updated at 15:48 13 September 2007

It may not sound like a healthy choice of meals, but a fry-up washed down with grapefruit juice could make some cancer drugs more effective.

Doctors believe that taking the breast cancer drug lapatinib at the same time as a fatty meal may make it work at least three times as well.

Add grapefruit juice into the equation and the researchers say the pills could be five times more effective than normal by aiding absorption.

Writing in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, the US team stressed that further tests were needed - and that patients should not alter how they take their cancer drugs.

But if their theory is right, it could hugely cut the cost of lapatinib, which could be available in the UK within months.

Dr Mark Ratain, of the University of Chicago, said: "We expect that one 250mg lapatinib pill accompanied by food and a glass of grapefruit juice may yield plasma concentrations comparable to five pills on an empty stomach."

The recipe could lead to some confusion among sufferers, however, as recent research showed that eating grapefruit may raise the risk of breast cancer.
