TITLE	Heavier babies 'face greater cancer risk'

Girls who are bigger than average at birth are more prone to breast cancer before the age of 50, according to research.

Babies weighing around 9lb are three times more likely to develop the disease than those tipping the scales at 6 1/2lb.

Researchers believe a fast rate of growth in the womb might be the cause, with heavier unborn girls exposed to more growth hormones.

For girls of the same weight and size, a baby born prematurely is again at higher risk of breast cancer before the menopause.

But women should not be alarmed by the findings, said Professor Valerie McCormack, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

'Breast cancer before the age of 50 is relatively rare,' she said. 'Most cases occur after the menopause when we found no link with birth size.

'What the study tells us is that there are pre-natal origins involved in breast cancer which put some women at increased risk. It gives us more clues to finding the causes of the disease.'

The study published in today's British Medical Journal involved more than 5,000 women born in Sweden between 1915 and 1929. A total of 63 had breast cancer before the age of 50.

The research team also found that girls who were taller at birth and had larger heads were at increased risk of early breast cancer.

Shorter pregnancies were independently linked with a higher risk of the disease before the age of 50.

Professor McCormack said there was no 'cut- off 'weight or height where women had a much greater or lesser risk.

Although there was nothing people could do in light of the findings, she said other research showed women who were heavier babies had more protection against heart disease.

'And that is a far greater health problem for older women than pre-menopausal breast cancer,' she added.
