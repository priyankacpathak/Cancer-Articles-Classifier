TITLE	Red wine may beat breast cancer

Red wine could be used to treat breast cancer after scientists found it contains a chemical which reduces the size of tumours.

The ingredient even wipes out some cancers altogether, tests on mice showed. Now US researchers are setting up trials to see if it has the same effect on women.

The chemical works by suppressing the production of oestrogen, a key growth factor for most types of tumour.

 But Dr Shiaun Chen, who led the study, said: 'We don't support the idea of people drinking a lot of red wine, as alcohol is also risk factor for breast cancer.'
