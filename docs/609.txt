TITLE	Lung cancer check

A new automated screening system called Lung Check could save thousands of lives through the early detection of lung cancer in at-risk people. Lung Check, aimed at people who smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day, involves coating saliva samples with natural chemicals called porphyrins. These attach themselves to cancer cells and highlight them. U.S. company Biomoda plans to launch Lung Check as an over-the-counter test aimed at heavy smokers.
