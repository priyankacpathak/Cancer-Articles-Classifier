TITLE	Good news, Easter eggs are healthy

Last updated at 16:45 21 March 2005

Just in time for Easter comes the news that will put a smile on the face of every chocoholic - chocolate is good for you after all.

Researchers have found it reduces the risk of heart disease and cancer and even boosts fertility.

But beware, not all chocolates are created equal. The key, apparently is a high concentration of cocoa. Cocoa beans are packed with antioxidant polyphenols which the experts believe help to reduce the risk of heart disease and may also help fight cancer.

Red wine in moderation and orange juice are already known to have similar properties.

Teresa McCarney, of Northern Ireland's College of Agriculture, said: "A 50g piece of dark chocolate has the same level of antioxidants as two glasses of wine. Chocolate contains iron for healthy blood, and zinc which helps boost the immune system and even fertility levels."
