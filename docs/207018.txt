TITLE	X-rays 'pose cancer risk'

Several hundred cancers may be caused each year in the UK as a direct result of X-ray examinations, researchers claim.

A study found that in Britain the risk of anyone up to the age of 75 getting cancer from diagnostic X-rays was about 0.6%.

This amounted to about 700 of the 124,000 cases of cancer diagnosed each year in the UK.

However it was still a lower proportion than in some other countries. In Japan, which has the highest annual exposure to X-rays in the world, the figure was put at more than 3%.

Diagnostic X-rays include mammograms and CT (computed tomography) scans.

While doctors generally accept there is a small risk of contracting cancer from an X-ray, the extent of the danger has been unclear.

The research in the Lancet medical journal is the most detailed assessment so far.

Dr Amy Berrington de Gonzales, from Cancer Research UK, and Professor Sarah Darby, from Oxford University, based their findings on the annual number of diagnostic X-rays taken in the UK and 14 other developed countries.

This data was combined with general cancer incidence rates, estimated X-ray radiation doses to individual body organs, and risk levels derived from survivors of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan at the end of the Second World War.

The researchers assumed there was no cut-off point below which X-ray exposure cannot induce cancer.
