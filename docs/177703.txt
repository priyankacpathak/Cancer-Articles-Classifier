TITLE	Sex disease doubles risk of cancer

by MIKE TAIT, Metro

A sexually transmitted disease which affects about one in ten young women almost doubles their risk of getting cancer, a new study suggests.

The link between chlamydia and ovarian cancer has raised fears of a medical timebomb.

Ovarian cancer is rarely treatable and kills nearly 5,000 middle-aged women each year.

Chlamydia, which has been rising dramatically in Britain in recent years, has been dubbed the 'silent epidemic' because there are few symptoms.

Tens of thousands of teenagers and women in their early 20s are thought to be infected but many do not realise.

US researchers studied 171 women with ovarian cancer and compared them with a similar group of healthy women.

'Women with the highest chlamydia antibodies had about a two-fold elevated risk of cancer,' said Dr Roberta Ness, who led the University of Pittsburgh study.

The findings came a week after the architect of the Government's sexual health strategy warned that Britain faced a public health crisis because of a surge in sexually transmitted diseases.

Cases of chlamydia have grown by more than 70 per cent since since Labour came to power in 1997, said Prof Michael Adler.

The bug has previously been linked with cervical cancer but the latest study, published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, is the first evidence it may also trigger ovarian cancer.

Chlamydia can also cause pelvic inflammation, ectopic pregnancy and infertility if left untreated.

It has emerged as a major health problem among teenagers and young adults who have unprotected sex - although it can be treated with antibiotics.

British experts said there was an urgent need for a national screening programme.
