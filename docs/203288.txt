TITLE	Suntan pill to cut skin cancer

by SUZY AUSTIN, Metro

An instant suntan pill could help cut the risk of skin cancer, scientists say.

The tablet - implanted under the skin - boosts the natural pigment melanin, which produces a tan.

If you then sit out in the sun, you are better protected against burning.

Tests show the drug, known as Melanotan, can reduce by more than half skin damage caused by the Sun - those with naturally pale skins benefit most.

Melanin protects the skin from harmful ultraviolet radiation.

Scientists developing the treatment dubbed it the Barbie Drug and hope GPs will be able to prescribe it to fair-skinned sunbathers as either an implant or rub-on lotion.

Researcher Prof Alan Cooper, from Sydney University, said: 'Melanin is the body's natural sunscreen. This is a way of increasing the amount of melanin we have.'

In Britain, skin cancer is increasing faster than any other form of the disease, with almost 50,000 new cases each year.

Since 1991, the number of men with the disease has increased by 64 per cent and women by 45 per cent.

Cancer Research UK said the rise in skin tumours was worrying and welcomed an anti-sunburn drug.

A spokesman for the charity added: 'This is an interesting study but it's at an early stage.

'The drug will have to go through further trials and checks before its efficacy and safety are proven.'

It will be at least a year before Melanotan is available.
