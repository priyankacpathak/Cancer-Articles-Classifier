TITLE	How IVF affects the body

Here, we look at the effects IVF treatment can have on your body and examine the link to breast cancer. ____________________________________________

A combination of drugs, some containing fertility hormones, is used to make the ovaries produce more eggs than they normally would. This, in turn, leads to high levels of oestrogen being produced in the body.

Two fertility drugs are commonly used to suppress the natural cycle and overstimulate egg production. Clomiphene is the hormone required in the latter stages of egg development. An antioestrogen, it is normally given as a fiveday course at the beginning of the menstrual cycle.

Gonadotrophin injections (a naturally occuring hormone) are given on a daily basis to stimulate the ovaries to produce the eggs. Release of the eggs is then brought about using an injection of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG).

Two weeks after the first injection of anti-oestrogen drugs to suppress the natural cycle, gonadotrophins are injected to stimulate the ovaries to produce the eggs.

Once the fertilised eggs are transferred back to the uterus, hormones are again given - in the form of injection or pessary - for two weeks after transfer. This encourages the lining of the uterus to grow and aids implantation of the embryos.

The more eggs that are produced, then the higher the levels of oestrogen in the body. Amount of oestrogen can increase tenfold, though it is heightened for a period of around only three weeks.

Lethargy, nausea, headaches or hot flushes may be experienced. There is an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, when too many eggs are produced in one cycle, can occur.

Many breast cancers have proteins called oestrogen receptors on the surface of their cells. Oestrogen attaches itself to the receptors and makes the cancer cells grow and divide.

Because infertility drugs stimulate the ovaries to produce oestrogen, it seems to increase the person's susceptibility to breast cancer.

Anthony Rutherford, spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in London, says: 'There is an argument that if you already have an oestrogen- dependent cancer, you might, at most, give it extended stimulation over a short period of about two weeks. But there is no causal link.'

Clara MacKay, of Breast Cancer Care, believes there should be research into the long-term health implications of IVF. She says: 'As medical advances go, it is still a relatively new development. It is important that women can be confident that it is safe.'

Above all, Breast Cancer Care advises women not to panic: 'Remain breastaware. It's important to get to know your own breasts so you can spot anything out of the ordinary.'
