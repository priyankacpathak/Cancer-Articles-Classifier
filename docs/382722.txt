TITLE	Supermarket tomatoes may prevent cancer

Last updated at 10:00 11 April 2006

Cancer-fighting tomatoes have been launched by a supermarket.

The specially-bred fruit contains high levels of an antioxidant that may cut the risk of prostate cancer.

The new variety was created naturally by crossing varieties with high lycopene levels, linked with reducing the risk of certain cancers. Tesco says it contains roughly a third more lycopene than other varieties.

Tesco sells more than 70,000 tons of tomatoes a year and trialling the new variety in Sussex stores.

Dr Chris Hiley, head of research for the Prostate Cancer Charity, said the effect of lycopene on prostate cancer had been studied but added: "We still can't come to a firm conclusion that the risk of prostate cancer is reduced by increasing lycopene intake.

"It is very clear that men should eat a varied and healthy diet, and tomato and tomato-based products have a place in that."

Tesco's Healthy Living tomatoes on the vine go on sale in selected stores tomorrow, priced at &pound;1.89 for a pack of four or five.

Ian Reed, the chain's produce technical manager, said: "This is the first step for Tesco into the developing world of functional foods and we plan to extend our range as public interest grows."
