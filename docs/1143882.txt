TITLE	Breast cancer rates drop as women turn their backs on HRT

Falling numbers of women taking HRT could be responsible for a slight drop in breast cancer rates, say researchers.

A new study claims to match the drop in use of hormone replacement therapy in women aged 50 to 54 years with falling rates of the disease.

But menopause experts point out that a worldwide health scare triggered a flight from HRT in the middle of 2002, yet rates of breast cancer started to fall two years earlier in Britain.

A similar phenomenon has been reported in the US, where breast cancer rates among women in their 50s started to fall in 1998.

The new study in the European Journal of Cancer shows the proportion of women aged 50 to 54 receiving HRT prescriptions halved from a peak of 40 per cent in 2000 to 20 per cent in 2006.

The figure dropped from 35 per cent to 15 per cent in the 55 to 59 age group.

The study found a reduction in the breast cancer rate among women in their early 50s - starting in 1999.

It has decreased at 0.8 per cent a year, with a cumulative fall of five per cent between 1999 and 2005.

Rates rose by 24 per cent among women in their 60s between 1999 and 2005, possibly due to the breast cancer screening programme detecting more tumours.

The rate has been falling among women aged 60 to 64 since 2003.

Women turned their backs on HRT after research from the Women's Health Initiative study in the US in 2002 found a slight increase in breast cancer, followed by the Million Women Study in the UK in 2003.

Professor Max Parkin from Queen Mary College at the University of London, who headed the new study, calculates there was a 14 per cent reduction in risk due to fewer women using HRT between 1999 and 2005 among women aged 50 to 59.

As a result there were 1,400 fewer cases in this age group in 2005 and 3,300 fewer over the period.

Professor Parkin, who is also a Cancer Research UK statistician, said 'Between 1996 and 2000 we can estimate that HRT use was responsible for an additional breast cancer risk of about 30 per cent to UK women in their 50s.

'But since 2000 there has been a striking decline in the estimated excess risk of breast cancer in all age groups.

'We cannot be absolutely sure that the drop in both breast cancer rates and breast cancer risk is the direct result of women giving up HRT.

'But the parallel is striking and it will be interesting to see if this decline continues over the next few years.'

However, Dr John Stevenson, reader in metabolic medicine at Imperial College London, and chairman of Women's Health Concern, said 'Immediate problems with the paper are that it starts by saying that HRT use declined from 2000-2001, but the decline in HRT use followed the first publication of the Women's Health Initiative in July 2002.

'Thus the decline in breast cancer incidence pre-dates the decline in HRT usage, and this is exactly what has been seen in the US. Thus this paper does not help show that HRT use and breast cancer incidence are linked.'

Professor Margaret Rees, reader in reproductive medicine at the University of Oxford, said 'Declining HRT use and a reduction in breast cancer incidence does not necessarily establish a causal connection between the two.'

She said the fall in incidence in the US started in 1998.

Professor Valerie Beral, professor of epidemiology at the University of Oxford, said 'In many countries, the incidence of breast cancer has fallen in the last few years following the sharp decline in the use of hormone replacement therapy.'
